## File descriptions

*    `convert.py` - python script for converting files
*    `train_input.csv` - the training set
*    `train_output.csv` - the training set with all OCR errors corrected
*    `train_output_bigrams.csv` - the solutions of the training set. This file is the actual output of the conversion script using the file train_output.csv as input.
*    `test_input.csv` - the test set
*    `test_baseline_bigrams.csv` - a sample submission file in the correct format. This file contains the set of bigrams found in test_input.csv, and the resulting F1 score is zero (or close to zero according to the evaluation performed by Kaggle in Class).
