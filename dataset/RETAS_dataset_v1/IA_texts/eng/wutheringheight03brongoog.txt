BroDte Sisters I have so far endeavoureit^ and must
tUU endeavour, to sp^ak^ rot the language of mere
ptnegyric, but that natural to a retuler whose critical
tense* 00 less than his sense of enjovment., shares in
the general slimutus which is derived from the power
and vitality of the bor^ks themselves. The Brontt'a,
are searching personalities. They challenge no less
than they attract. Their vigorous effect upon the
reader's sympathies and judgment has been ahvays
part of their ascendency^ and one great secret of their
endurmg fame. To handle their work in a spirit of
flat etilojEfv and recommen < lation > vould ! > e an olFence

is an element of its charm. The romantic inequulillt^s^
the romantic akernalionsof jwweraiid weakness which
these books show, appeal to tlioiie deep and mingled
instincts of the English mind which have produced our
rich, violent, faulty, incomparable English literature. ■
When we are«under the spell of the " BTOnte stories we
admii'e and we protest with almost equal warmth ; we ^
lavish upon them the same varieties of feeling as the ■
poet, wlio brings to his love no cold, monotonous horn-
age^ but—'praise, blame^ kisses^ tears and smiles/ For _
inevitably the critic's manner catches tlie freedom of I
the author's* He will not hesitate dislike; such a
mental attitude cannot maintain itself in the Bronte^^
neigh bourliood. He will strike when he is hurt, and
raise tije pagans of praise when he is pleased, with the
fiunkness which such combatants deserve. In each of
her novels, as it were» Charlotte Bronte touches the
shield of the reader; she does not woo or | > eriiuade ■
him; she attacks him, and^ complete as his ultimjite'
surrender may be, he yields fighting. He'will still bo _
talking,^ and there is no help for it. I
And if this is the case with Charlotte Bronte, it is
still more so with Emily. Emily's genius Wiis the
greater of the two, yet of a similar quality and fibre*
It provokes even more vivid reactions of feeling in the
reader; and yet, in those who have felt her spell, she
wins an ultimate sympathy and compels an ultimate
atliniration so strong that no one wishes to examine the M
stages of his own conquest. We passionately accept
her, or we are untouched by her* And if vve passion
ately accept her* we are apt to forget our own critica
wrestles by the way ; we are impatient of demurs, ol

balf-wonls, and all mere ingenuities of opinion cun^
earning her and tbat work which is her direct anJ

Neverthoiesg^ ^criticism has still a real work to do
with this stnmge novel anti these few passionate
pMsma of Emily Brontu's. In the first placGj the novel
has aol even yet taken the place which rightly belongs
to it. In Mr Saintsbury's belief, fdr instance, Emily
Bronte's work, though he grants ita originality, has
been *^ extravagantly praised,'and is *too small in bulk
and Ux > limited m chaiucter to be put really high/ (It
may be remarked in passing that it is, indeed, smaller
[in bttlk than Mr. Saintsbury imagines, since he attrib*
^tiles to Emily the hmik of her sister Anne^'The Tenant
of Wildfell Hall/)'And e\'en fur Mr. Leslie iStophen's
generous and catholic Uiste« Emily Bronte io'^Wuther-

feeble grasp upon externjtl facts makes her book a kind

those four or five poems of the first order which Emily
BroTito has added to our literature. While for an
earlier generation of critics,'Wuthering'II eights'was,
^s a rule, matter for denunciation rather than praise 5
and it was again a poet — Sydney Dobell in the'Palla-
dium'^ — who, almost alone, had the courage to under*
stand. The pathetic letter written by Charlotte to
Mr. Williams, little more than three weeks before
Emily's death, which describes the reading by the sis-

Neirertbeless* the * North American Review * was only
Bwimming with the stream, anticipating by a few
months the violence of the'Quarterly,'and expressing
the verdict of an overwhelming majority of the public.
Moreover, those among ua of a later generation who

youth, afid Mrs. GaskelTs wonderful biography had
stamped the stories and personalities of her two sisters
upon the inmost fibres of memory and pity, * Wuther-

aod with a prior sense of repulsion, which dropped a
veil between book and reader, and was in truth only
the result of an alt but universal tenor of opinion
amongst our elders.
Indeed, Charlotte Bronte herself, in the touching
and eloquent preface which she wrote for a new edition
of'Wulbering Heights'in 1S50, adopts a tone towards
bar sister*s work which contains more than a shade of

the joanger CatheHne, > nd some touches of *a certain
strange beauty'in the fierceness of her mother, of a
petleetning honesty amid her j > erversity and passion*
She points out the wiifulness of the creative gift, and
tlie incalculable dominance that it acquires over tlie
artist. She vindicates her sister from the charge of
any personal association with the brutalities she de-
scribes. * She had scarcely more practicixl knowledge
of the people round her than a nun has of the country
folk who sometimes pass her conv^ent giites.'For
iieathcliff she had no model but the * vision of Iter own

the North, and the moors, and the dwellers upon them,
with the suOicient knowledge of the artist ; and only
those witi iind her wholly unintelligible or repulsive

Mrs. Gaskeirs comments upon * Wuthering Heights'

oected with Eranwel] Bronte.'All I say is, that never,
I believe^ did women |)osses$ed of such wonderful gifts
exercise them with a fuller feeling of responsibility for
their use. As to mistakes, they stand now — as authors
03 well as women — before the judgment-seat of God.'
One bears in these sentences, with their note of pro-
teatmg emotion, no less than in Charlotte^s tender and
dignified defence, the echo of aD angry public opinion^
imijgnant in the typical English way that any young
woman, and eBpecialiy any clergyman's daughter, should
write of such unbecoming scenes and persons as those
which form the subject of'Wuthering Heights,* and
determined if it could to punish the offender.
But for us, fifty years iater» how irrelevant are both
the attack and the defence! One might as well plead
that Marlowe meant no harm by creating Tambnrlaine,
or Victor Hugo in imagining Quasimodo or the fight
with the pUnvre^ or the central incident of * Le Roi
s'amuse/ *Wuthering Heights^ lives as great imagi-
nation, of which we must take the consequences, the
bad with the good; and will continue to live, whether
it pleased as personally or no. Moreover, the hook has
much more than a mere local or personal significance.
It belongs to :w [nirticular European raonientj and like
Charlotte's work, though not in the same way, it holds
a typical and representative place in the English litera^
tare of the century. If we look back upon the circura-
fttancee of its composition, the main facta seem to be

Emily Bronte, like her sister, inherited Cellic bloody
together with a stern and stoical traclitton of daily life.
She was a wayward, imaginative girl, physically deli-
cate, brought up in loDeliness and poverty, amid a J
harsh yet noble Iandscai > e of hdl, moor and streain, ■
Owing to the fact tbat her father had some hterary
cultivation, and an Irish quickness of intelligence be- J
yond that of his brother-clergy, this child of genius had
from the beginning a certnin access to good books, and
through books and newspapers to the central world of ■
thought and of affairs. In 1S27, when Emily was nine,
she and her sisters used to amuse themsalv^es in the
wintry firelight by choosing imaginary islands to gov-
ern, and pwtjpling them with famous men. EmiJy
chose the I«le of Arran, and for inhabitants Sir Walter
Scott and the Lockharts ; while Charlotte chose the
Duke of Wellington and Christopher North. In 1829,
Charlotte, in a fragment of journal, describes tlje news-
papers taken by the family in those troubled days of
Catholic emancipation and reform, and lets us know
that a neighbour lent them'I3lackwood*s Magazine,'
*the most able periodical there is,'IL vvjis, indeed, b^''

in touch with the current literature, the criticism,
poetry, and Ection of their day. During their eager, I

in English imag'ination during the first half of tho
U^ntury. In ISuo, Hannah More, protesting against the

flashes of genius, unite the taste of the Goths'with

I mg favour for Gisrman literature.''There is no one
^^f our younger, more vigorous periodicals,'he says,

eign Review'and'Fraaer/ — in'Blackwood- also,
through the years when Charlotte and Emily Bronte,
then at the mo & t plastic stage of thought and imagina-
tion» were delighting in it, one may find a constant
series of translations from the German, of articles on
German memoirs and German poets, and of literary re-
flections and esbimatos, which testify abundantly to
the vogue of all things Teutonic, both with men of let-
ters and the public. In 1840,'Maga,'in the inflated
phrase of the time, says, indeed, that the Germans are
aspiring'to wield the literary sceptre, with as lordly a
sway as ever graced the dynasty of Voltaire. No one
who is even superficially acquainted with the floating
literature of the day can fail to have observed how
tlauntingly long-tlespised Germanism spreads its phy-
lacteries on every side < * In the year before, (1S39)
^Blackwooil'published a translation of Tieck's'Pietro
d^Abano/ a wild robber-anU-magician story, of the tj'^pe
which spread the love of monster and vampire, witch
and werewolf, through a Europe tired for the moment
of eighteenth-century common-sense ; and, more impor-
tant still, a long section, excellently rendered, from
Goethe's'Dichtung und Wahrheit,'In that year
Emily Bronte was alone with her fatlier and aunt at
liawortb, while her two sisters were teaching as gover-
nesses.'Blackwood - came as usual, and one may
surely im:»gine the long, thin girl bending in the fire-
light over these pages from Goethe, receiving the im-
press of their lucidity, their charm, their sentiment and
^natural magic,'nourishing from tliem the vivid and
Tnasterly intelligence which eight years later protluced
* Wuthering Ileights.*

But she was to make a nearer acquaintance with
bernian thought and fancy tlian cfjuki be i^ot from the
pigw of " Blackwootr and'p'raaor/ In 1S42 she and
Cbirlotte journeye^l to Brussels, and there a certain
dirergence seems to have declared itself between the
literary ti & stes and affinities of the two sisters. While
Charloltu, who had already become an eager reader of
French books, and was at alL times more ready to take
Uie colour of an environment than Emily» was carried,
hy the teaching of M, Ileger acting* upon her s[)ecial
qualities and capacities, into that profounder apprecia*
Uyn of the French Komantic spirit and inethod which
ihofvft itself thenceforward in all her books, Emily set
b**rself ag^ainst Rrussels, against M. lleger, and against
the French motlels that he was constantly proposing to
tbe smtcrs. She was homesick and mieerahle ; tier atti-
Imle of mind was partly obstinacy, partly, perhaps, a
milter of instinctive and passionate pjeference. She
larnt German diligently, and it has always been as-
Rimed, though I hardly know on what first authority,
that she read a good deal of German fiction^ and especial-
l\ Hoffmann's tales, at Bruss*jls. Certainly, we hear of
her in the following year, when she was once more at
ikworthy and Charlotte was still at Hriissels, as doing
h« household work'with a German book open beaide
5»f/ though we are not told what the books were;
iDiJ, as I learn from Hr. Shorter, there are indications
Uitt the t > maU library Emily loft behind her contained
mucli Geruiau literature.
Two years later, Charlotte, in 1S45, discovered the
poems which, at least since 1834, Emily had been writ-
ing.'It took hours/ says the elder sister, *to reconcile
IXU
WUTIIERING HEIGHTS
her to the discovery I had made, and days to persuade
Ler that such poems merited publication.'But Char-
lotte prevailed, and in 1846 Messrs. Aylott & Jones
published the Httle volume of'Poems by Cuprer, Ellis,
and Acton BelL'It obtained no success; but*the mere
effort to succeed,'says Charlotte^'had given a wonder-
ful zest to existenco ; it must be pursued. We each set
to work on a prose tale: Ellis Bell produced " Wuther-
ing Heights, " Aeton Bell *'Agnee Grey, " and Currer
Bell also wrote a narrative in one volume* —'The Pro-
fessor.* For a year and a half * Wuthering Heights/
in common n'ith * Agnes Grey'and'The Professor,*
travelled wearily from publisher to publisher. At last
Messrs. Newby accepted the first two. But they lin-
gered in the press for months, and'Wuthering Heights'
appeared at last, after the publication of ^ Jane Eyre/
and amid the full noise of its fame, only to be re-
ceived as an earlier and cruder work < jf Currer Bell's,
for which even those who admired'Jane Eyre'could
find little praise and small excuse. Emily seems to
have shown not a touch of jealousy or discouragement.
She is not known, however, to have written anything
more than a few verses— amongst them, indeed, the im-
mortal *Last Lines'— later than'Wuthering Heights,'
and during the last year of her life she seems to liave
given herself — true heart, and tameless soul ! — now to
supporting her wretched brother through the final
stages of his physical and moral decay, and now to
consultation with and sympathy for Charlotte in thd
writing of'Shirley.'Branwell died in September, and
Emily Wits alrtnuly ill on the day of his funeral. By
the middle of December, at the age of thirty, she waft

Tiiality with hHmj > 0ring circumstances was over. The
stofv of that iiifirvellous dyin;^ has been often told, by
Cb & rtotte first of & 1J, then by Mrs. Gaskell, and again
by Maclnme Darmesteter, in the vivid study of Emily
Bnmtijy which represents the homage of a new poetic
geaeratioTi. Let us recall Charlotte^s poignant sen-
Kerer in M her life bad abe lingered over imj task
Uitt l & j before her, and sha did not linger now. She sfink
opidlj. She mude haste to leiive ua. Yet wliilepbyai-
c & lljr she perished, mentally she grew stronger than we

ifroat she met snUuring, I looked on ber with an anguish
ttf voider and love, I have seen nothing like it ; but in-
deet] I have never seen her paraliel in anything. Stronger
than a man. simpler than a cbildi her nature stood alone.
The awful point was, that while full of ruth for others*
on berself she had no pity; the spirit was inexorable to
Ibe flf^flh ; from the trembling hand^ the nnnerved limhs,
the faded eyes^ the same sorvice was exacted as in health.
... She died December 19, 1848*
'Stronger than a man, simpler than a child :'— these
words are Emily Bronte's true epitaph, both as an
nist and as a human being. Her strength of will and
rm & gia & tion struck those Avho knew her and those who
nad ber as often inhuman or terrible; and with this
waa combined a simplicity partly of genius partly of a
itrange innocence and spirituality, which gives her a
pjaoe apart in Eng^lish letters. It is important to real-
be that of the three books written simultaneously by
the three sisters, Emily^a alone shows genius already

'Wutbering Heights* then is the product of romai
tic imagination, working probably under influence
from German literature, and marvellously fused witi
local knowledge and a realistic power which, within il
own range, has seldom been surpassed. Its few great
faults are soon enumerated. The tendency to extniv]
gance and monstrosity may, as we have seen, be takei
to some extent as belonging more to a literary fashioi
than to the artist. Tieok and Hoffmann are full of rar < l
ing and lunatic beings who sob, shout, tear out theii
hair by the roots, and live in a perpetual state of pei
eonal violence both towards themselves and their neigh*
hours. Emily Bronte probably i-eceived from them an
additional impulse towards a certain wildness of manner
and conception which was already natural to her Irish
blood, to a woman brought up amid the solitudes of thi
moors and the ruggedness of Yorkshire life fifty yeai
ago, and nntural also, alas! to the sister of the opiun
eater and drunkard Branwell Bronte.
To this let us add a certain avrkwardness and coi
fusion of structure ; a strain of ruthless exaggeraiioaj
in the character of Ileathcliflr; and some absurcntii
and contradictions in the character of Nelly Dean.
The latter criticism indeed is bound up with the first.
Nelly Dean is presented as tlte faitliful and affectiunuie
nurse, the only good angel both of the elder and the
younger Catherine, But Nelly Dean does the m <
treacherous, cruel, and indefensible things, simply tha(
the story may move* She becomes the go-between fo|

mere violence and excesa, and what might havft
a^lnan becomes a monster. There are speeches and
actions of Catherine's, moreover, contained in tbeia
central pages which have no relation to any life of
men and women that the true world knowa. It may
be said indeed that the writer's very ignorance of cer-
tain facts and relations of life, combined with the force
of imaginative passion which she throws into her con-
ceptioHB, produces a special poetic effect — a strange
and bodiless tragedy — unique in literature* And therafl
is much truth in this ; but not enough to vindicate thes^

of ugliness and a dying magic — * settling unawares* —
which is the cbaracteristic note of the Brontes, and of
all that is best in Uomantic literature. I^Never for a

and the Yorkshire folk — Jook at the picture of Isabella's
wasteful porridge - making and of Joseph's grumbling
rage, amid her gruesome experience as a bride ; never

Heathcliff^s ruffianism ; and yet through it all the in-

master could have conceived, lafe and love rebel and
reassert themselves in the wild slight love-story of
Ilareton and Cathy^ which break the final darkness
like a gleam of dawn upon the moors; and de^th
tames and silences for ever all that remains of Ileath-
cliff's futile cruelties and wasted fury.
But what a death! Oeathcliff has tormented and
oppressed Catherine's daughter; and it is Catherine's
shadow that lures htm to his doom, through every ata

'Is he a ghoul or vampire?* I mused. *I had read
of Buch hideous incarnate demons*'So says Nelly
Dean just before Heathcliff's death. The remark is
not hers in truth, but Emily Bronte's, and where it
stands it is of great slgtiiticaQce. It points to the
world of German horror and romance, to which we
know that she had access. That world was congenial
tn her, as it was congenial to Southey, Scott, and Cole-

the liauuting of Heathcliff is to the coarser horrors
of Tieck and Hoffmann, so is her place to theirs. For

Goethe, rather than with Hoffmann,'and thereby with

Shook, like a clarion-blast, my soul —
in the verses now called * L'lst Lines,* which Charlotte
discovere*! in the writer's desk after her death. Emily's
religions ifaith was a mystery in life, but in dying she
gave it voice, and it is the voice of her century — a cry
in which is summed up, as it were, the sound of many
waters, and the last but sufficient consolation of in-
numerable souls.

OF
ELLIS AND ACTON BELL
It h» & been thought that all the works published under the
names of Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell were, in reality, the
production of one person. Thla tiiistB.ke I endeavoured to
rectify by a few words of disclaimer prefixed to the third
edition of'Jane Eyre/ These, too^ it appears, failed to gain
geD«ral credence, and now, on the occasion of a reprint of
'Wnthering Heights'and'Agnes Grey/ I am advised dis-
tiDctly to state how the case really stands.
Indeed, I feel myself that it is time the obscurity attend*
ing those two names — BIlis and Acton — weis done away.
The bttle mystery, which formerly yielded some harmless
pleasure, has lost its interest : circumstances are changed*
It becomes, then, my duty to e^tpldn briefly the origin and
aathorship of the books written by Currer, Ellis, and Acton
Bell
About five years ago, my two sisters and myself, after a
somewhat prolonged period of separation, found ourselves
tnit & d, and at home. Kesident in a remote district, where
lucation had made little progress, and where, consequently^
th^o was oo inducement to seek social intercourse beyond

our own domef^tic circle, we were wholly dependent on
oiH'Belvea [Lud eticii other, on books and study* for the enjoy-
uieut8 and occupations of life. The highest gtimulu^ as

ThiH barbii < yi cooiniiuik'^utioit iAud con^uiuttiuri hiuJ been di;
continued ; hence it enBued, thiU we were niutually igooranl
of the progress we might respectively have Hiftde.
One day, in the autumn of 1845, I accidentally lighted oq|
a MB. volume of verse in my sister Eniily*s handwriting.
Of courae, I wna not aurpiised, knowing that she could and
did write verse : I looked it over, and something more than
surprise seized me — a deep conviction that these were not
cooimon effusions^ nor at all like tlie poetry women generaUy
write. I thought them condensed and terse, vigorous and
genuine. To my ear tliey had also a peculiar music — wild,
melancholy, and elevating.
My sister Emily was not a person of dGmouBtraiive <
character, nor one on the recesses of whose mind and feeiinga ■
even those nearest and dearest to her could, with impunity, ^
intrude unlicensed ; it took hours to reconcile her to the
discovery I had made, and days to persuade her that such
poems merited puhlication, I knew, however, that a mind
like hers could not be without some latent ^park of honour-
able ambition, and refused to be discouraged in my attempts
to fan that spark to Bame. fl
Meantime, my younger sister quietly produced some of i
her own compositions, intimating that, since Emily's had
given me pleasure, 1 might like to look at hers, I could not
but be a partial judge, yet I thought that these verses, too >
had a sweet, sincere pathos of their own.
BLLI6 AND ACTON BELL
ilT
We had very early cherished the dream of one day be-
ooming authors. This dream, nevtar relinquished even when
disiftnoe divided and absorbing tasks occupied us, no^?
suddenly acqtdred strength and conBistency : it took the
character of a resolve, Wc agreed to arrange a small selec-
tion of our poems, and, if possible, fco get them printed*
Averse to personal publicity, we veiled our own names under
& OSQ of Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell ; the ambiguous choice
being dictated by a sort of conscientious scruple at assutning
Chnatian names positively masculine, while wo did not like
to declare ourselves women, because — without at that time
^^specting that our mode of writing and thinking was not
^^Miat is called'feminine'— we had a vague impressioD that
^^Hbthoresses aiB liable to be looked on with prejudice ; we
^^Bld noticed how critics sometimes use for their chastisement
^^^le weapoti of personality, and for their reward, a datteryj
which is nob true praise.
The bringing out of our little book was hard work. As
Wis 80 be expected, neither wo nor our poems were at all
wanted ; but for this we had been prepared at the outset ;
Ihoogh inexperienced ourselvGS, wo had read the experience
of others. The great puzzle lay in tho difficulty of getting
answers of any kmd from the publishers to whom we
applied. Being greatly harassed by this obataclcj I ven-
Kred to apply to the MesHrg. Chambers, of Edinburgh, for a
_ > rd of advice : they may have forgotten the circumstance,
hi\ I have not, for from them I received a brief and buai-
QttB-like, hut civil and sensible reply, on which we acted^
a & d at last made a way.
The book was printed : it is scaroely known, and all of
h that merits to bo known are tho poems of Ellis BelL

poems baa not indeed received the confirmation of much
favourable criticiam ; but I muat retftin it notwithBtaading,
lU-succesa failed to crash us : the mere eSbrt to suooeed
had given a wonderful zeat to ei^istpence ; it must be pm-
sued* We each eet to work on a prose tale ! Ellis Bell pro-
duced'Wuthering Heights/ Acton Bell'Agnes Grey,'and
Currer Bell also wrote a narrative in one volume. These
M 8 S, were perseveringly obtruded upon various pnb*
liBhers for the space of a year and a half ; usually, their fate
was an ignominioua and abrupt diamissal.
At last * Wuthering Heights * and'Agnes Grey'were
accepted on terms somewhat impoverishing to the two
authors ; Currer Beirs hook found acceptance nowhere, nor
any acknowledgment of merit, so that something like the
chill of despair began to invade her heart. As a forlorn hope,
she tried one publishing house more — Messrs* Smith, Elder
and Co. Ere long^ in a much shorter space than that on
which experience had taught her to calculate — there came a _
letter, which she opened in the dreary expectation of finding I
two hajrd, hopeless lines, intimating that Meaara. Smith,
Elder and Go.'were not disposed to publish the M8.,* and,
instead, she took out of the envelope a letter of two pages.
She read it trembling. It declined, indeed, to publish that
tale, for buainesa reasons, but it diacnssed its merits and de-
merits BO courteously, so considerately, in a spirit & o rationali
with a discrimination so enlightened, that thia very refusal
cheered the author better than a vulgarly expressed accapt-
anoe would have done. It was added, that a work in threo
volumes would meet with careful attention. H
I was then just completing * Jane Eyre,'at which I had
been working while the one-volume tale was plodding its
weary round in London: in three weeks I sent it off;

ootmnencement of September, 1847 ; it > oBioie out before the

* Agnes Grey/ my aistera'works, which had already been in
the press for months, still lingered under a diSbrent managa-
ment
They appeared at last Critics failed to do them jusbioe.
The immature but very real powers revealed in * Wuthering
Heights'were scarcely recognised ; its import and nature
were misunderstood ; the ideality of its author was misre-
presented ; it wa9 said that this was an earlier and ruder
Attempt of the same pen w^hlch had produced'Jane Eyre/
UDJfist and grievous error [ Wo laughed at it at first, but I
deeply lament it now. Hence, I fear, arose a prejudice
against the book. That wri & er who could attempt to palm
off an inferior and immature production under cover of one
successful effort, must indeed be unduly eager after tho
secondary and sordid result of authorship, and pitiably in-
differeat to its true and honourable mead. If reviewers and
the public truly believed this, no wonder that they looked
darkly on the cheat.
Yet I must not be understood to make these things sub-
ject for reproach or complaint \ I dare not do bo ; respect for
my sister's memory forbids me. By her any such querulous
manifestation would have been regarded as an unworthy and
ofGensive weakness.
It is my duty» as well as my pleasure, to acknowledge
one exception to the general rule of criticism. One writer,^
endowed with the keen vision and fine sympathies of geniua,
has discerned the real nature of * Wuthering Heights/ and
1^ with equal accuracy, noted its beauties and touched on
< See the Palladium for September 1850.

it€ faults. Ttxt often do reviewers remind us of the tnob of
Astrologers, Chaldeans, and Soothsayers gathered before the
* writing on the wall/ and unable to read the characterB or
make known the interpretation, We have a right to rejoice
when a true seer comes at last, some man in whom la & n ex-
Ejellent spirit, to whom have been given light, wisdom^ and
undeTBtanding ; who can accurately read the'Mene, Meao^
Tekel, Upharsin'of an original mind (however unripe, how-
ever inefficiently cxiltured and partially expanded that mind
may be) ; and who can say with confidence, * This is the in-
terpretation thereof.
Yet even the writer to whom I allude shares the mistake
about the authorship, and does me the injustice to suppose
that there was equivoque in ray former rejection of this
honour (aa an honour I regard it). May I as & ure hitn that I
would scorn in this and in every other case to deal in
equivoque ; I believe language to have been given us to
make our meaning clear, and not to wrap it in diebonest
doubt?
'The Tenant of Wildfell Hall/ by Acton Bell, had Hke^
wise an unfavourable reception. At this I cannot wonder.
The choice of subject was an entire mistake. Nothing less
congruous with the writer's nature could he conceived. The
motives which dictated this choice were pure, but, I think,
slightly morbid* She had, in the course of her lifcj been
called on tocontemplate, near athand^andforalongtime.the
terrible effects of talents misused and faculties abused : hers
was naturally a sensitive, rcsDrved, and dejected nature ; what
she saw sank very deeply into her mind ; it did her harm,
She brooded over it till she believed it to be a duty to repro-
duce every detail (of course with fictitious characters, incidents,
and BLtuations), as a warning to others. She hated her work,
I
I
I
ELLIS AND ACTON BELL

Imt would pursue it. When reasoned with on the subject,
she regarded such reaBoninga as a temptation to self-indul-
pukoe. Bhe muat be honest ; ghe mu^t not vanibh^ sotteu,
DOr conceal. This well-rDeant reBolution brouglib ou ber
misoonstmction^ and some abuse, which she bore» as h was
h & t custom to bear whatever was unpleasantt with mild,
steady patience. She wn,s a very sincere and practical
Christian, but the tinge of religious melancholy communis
Cftted a sad shade to her brief, blameless life.
Neither Ellis nor Acton allowed herself for one moment
to flink -under want of encouragemeut ; energy nerved the one,
and endurance upheld the other* They were both prepared
to Iry again ; I would fain think that hope and the sense of
power were yet strong within them, But a great change
apprcMhched ; affliction came in that shape which to [anticipate
18 dread; to look back on, grief. In the very heat and
bitrden of the day, the labourers failed over their work.
My sister Emily first declined* The details of her illness
are deep-branded in my luenaory, but to dwell on them,
either in thought or narrative, is not in my |x > wer. Never
in all her life had she lingered over any task that lay before
her, and she did not linger now. She sank rapidly. She
made haste to leave us. Yet, white physically she perished,
mentally she grew stronger than we had yet known her.
Day by day, when I saw with what a front she met suffering,
I looked ou her with an anguish of wonder and love. I have
seen notliing like it ; but, iudeed, I have never seen her
parallel in anything. Stronger than a man, eimpler than a
child, her nature stood alone. The awful point was, that
while full of rutih for others, on herself she had no pity ;
the spirit was incKorable to the flesh; from the trembling
hand, the unnen'ed limbs, the faded eyes, the same service

and witneBS thiS] and not dare to remanstrater was a pBiiii no
words can render.
Two cruel months of hope and fear passed painfully by,
and the dEi.y came at last when the terrors and pains of death
were to he undergone by this treasur^^ which had grown
dearer and d & a.rei: to our hearts as it wasted before our eyes^
Towards the decline of that day, we liad nothing of EmOy
but her mortal remains as consumption left them« She died
December 19, 1848.
We thought this enough : but we were utterly and pre-
Bumptuously wrong. She was not buried ere Anne fell ill-
She had not been committed to the grave a fortnight^ before
we received distinct intimation that it was neceBsory bo
prepare our minds to see the younger sister go after the elder.
Accordingly, she followed in the same path with slower step*
and with a patience that equalled the other's fortitude. I
have said that she was religious, and it was by leaning on
those Christian doctrines in which she firmly believed,
that aha found support through her moat painful journey. I
witneBsed their efiScacy in her latest hour and greatest trial,
and must bear my testimony to the calm triumph \\i\h which
they brought her through. She died May 28, 1849.
What more shall I say about them ? I cannot and need
not say much more. In externals, they were two uuobtruaive
women ; a perfectly secluded life gave them retiring mannera
and habits. In Emily's nature the extremes of vigour and
simplicity seemed to meet. Under an unsophisticated
culture, inartificial tastes, and an unpretending outside, lay
a secret power and fire that might have informed the brain
and kindled the veins of a hero ; but she had no worldly
wUdom ; her powers were unadapted (o the practical busincsa

I tioDfkl reserve and taciturnity placed and kept her in the
I ihade, and covered her mind, and especially her feelings,
with a sort of nun-like veil, which was rarely lifted. Neither
Emily nor Anne was learned ; they bad no thought of filling
their pitpchers at the well-spring of other minds ; they always;
wrote from the impulse of nature, the dictates of intuition,
& Qd from such stores of observation as their limited expe-
rience had enabled them to amass. I may sum up all by
saying, that for etrangeis they were nothing, for superficial
observers less than nothing ; but for those who had known
Iham all tb«ir lives in the intimacy of dose relationship, they
vai« gentunely good and truly great.

EDITOR'S PREFACE
TO THE NEW EDITION OF
WUTHERING HEIGHTS*
I HAVKjuat read over'Wothering Heights/ and^ for thefirsl
Vime, have obtaiDdd a clear glimpse of what a^re teitued (and^
perhaps, really ykte) its faults ; have gained a definite nolion
of how it appears to other people — to strangers who knew
Dioihiiig of the author ; who are unacquainted with the locali^'
where the scenes of the story are Laid ; to whotn the inhabi-
tuita, the customs, the natural characteristics of the outlying
hilla and hamlets in the West Riding of Yorkshire are things
ftlien and unfamiliar*
To all Buch'Wuthering Heights'must appear a rude
*tid strange production. The wild moors of the North of
fio^land can for them have no iatetest: the lau^^u^e, t^e
BtsaneiA, the very dwelUngs and household customs of the
foMered inhabitants of those districts must he to such
WiiBn in a great measure nninteUigible, and-— where
iMelUgible — repulsive. Men and women whOj perhaps,
Qitarally very calm, and with feelings moderate in degree^
and little nscirked in kind, have been tmined from their
mdle to observe the utmost evenness of manner and
goardediieoa of languaget will hardly know what to make

Mentoi-a as harsh as themselves, A large class of readei
likewisei will suffer greatly from the introduction into
pages of thia work of words printed with all their let!
which it has become the custom to represent by the inil
and tinal letter only — & blank line filling the interval,
may aa well say at once (hat, for this circumetance, it is OT
of my power to apologise; deeming it, myself, a ratioj
plan to write words at full Length. The practice of hintiii|
by single letters those expletives with which profane
violent persons are wont to garnish their discourse, strike
me as a proceeding which, however well meant, is weak and
futile. I cannot tell what good it does— what feeling it
ap & rea — what hon'or it concoEds.
With regard to the rusticity of'Wuthering Heights/
admit the charge, for I feel the quality. It is rustic
through. It is moorish, and wild, and knotty as a root ol ^
heath. Nor was it natural that it should be otherwise ; the
autJaor being herself a native and nursling of the moora.
Doubtless, had her lot been cast in a town, her writings, if
she had written at all, would have possessed auot
character. Even had chance or taste led her to Gh <
a simihur subject, she would have tr^atad it otherwise.
Had Ellis Bell been a lady or a gentleman accustomed to
what is called'the world,'her view of a remote and unre-
claimed region, as well as of the dwellers therein, would have
differed greatly from that actually taken by the home-bred
country girl* Doubtless it would have been wider— more
comprehensive : whether it would have been more

or more truthful is not SQ certain. As far els the f^cenery and
locality are concerned, it could scarcely have been so
^pathetio : EUis Bell did not describe as one whose eye
Hid lAsle alone found pleasure in the prospect ; her native
bilk were far more to her than a spectacle ; they were what
tha lived in, and by, as much as the wild birds, their tenants^
orta the heather, their produce. Her deBcriptions, then, of
muTtd scenery are what they should be, and all they
aboald be.
Where deUneatioa of human character is concerned^ the
cu« is different. I am bound to avow that she had scarcely
Qkore pfactical knowledge of the peasantry among & t whom
^ lived, than a nun haa of the country people who some-
liaiee pass her convent gates. My sister's disposition was
Dot oatorally gregarious ; circumstances favoured and fos-
bared her tendency to seclusion ; except to go to church or
tike a walk on the hills, she rarely i^oased the threshold
of heme. Though her feeling for the people round was
beDevoIent, itttercourse with them she never sought ; nor,
wiJh very few exceptions, ever eKperienoed. And yet she
kiiflw & hem : knew their ways, their language, their family
hirtories ; she could hear of them with interest, and talk of
than with detail^ minute, graphic, and accurate ; but vnih
them, she rarely eitchanged a word. Hence it ensued that
what her uiind had gathered of the real concerning them,
VBU too exclusively confined to those tragic and terrible
Is of which, in listening to the secret annals of every rude
icinage^ the memory is sometimes compelled to receive the
impress. Her imagination, which was a spirit more sombre
than sunny, more powerful than sportive, found in such
Iciite material whence it wrought creations like HeathclifT,
Ute EftTDahaw, like Catherine. Having foiled these beic^s,

she did not know wbftt ahe had done. If the auditor of her
work, when read ia maiiuscnpt, shuddered under the grind-
ing influence of nafcores so relentleaa and Lmplacablep of spirits
fio lost and faJlen ; if it was complained that the mere
hearing of certain vivid and fe & rful Boenes banished sleep by
night, and disturbed mental peaoe by day. Ktlis Bell wonld
wonder what was me & nt^ and suspect the compltkLnant qfl
affectation. Had she but lived, her raitid would of itee^
have grown like a strong tree, loftier, stroighter, wider-
spreading, and ite matured fruity would have attained ■

lightning : let me point to ihose Bpota where clouded day-
light and the eclipsed sun still attest their existence. For a

think theae qualities do not shine so well incarnate in a man
as they would do in a woman, hut Ellis Bell could never be
brought to comprehend this notion : nothing moved her more
than any insinuation that the faithfuluesa and clemency, the
loDg-suCEering and loving-kindness which are eeteemed virtuee
in the daughters of Eve, t > e)Come foibles in the sons of Adam.
She held that mercy and forgiveness are the divineet

I VDoId have made a few comments, and requested a ahort
lulbaeY of tlio place from the aurly owner ; but his attitude ab
llvfi door appeared to demand my speedy entmnce, or
oompleto doparture, and I hiul no desire to aggravate his
Impatiencti previous to in^pgcting the i > enetnilium.
One step brought us into the family sitting-room^ without
My intfoductory lobby or passage: they call it here * the
house'pre-eminently. It includes kitchen and parlour^
geoenUly ; but I believe at Wuthcring Heights the kitchen h
foreed to retreat altrogether into another quarter : !k% least I
di^mgoisbod s, chatter of tongues, and a clatter of culinary
otcnals, deep within ; and I observed no signs of roasting,
boiling, or baking, about the huge fireplace ; nor any glitter
of copper Sivueepans and tin cullenders on the walls. One
tjnd, indeed* reflected splendidly both light and heat from
riaks of immena© pewter dishes, interspersed with silver
jugi nod tankards, towering row after row, on a vast oak
dresaer* to the very roof. The hitter bad never been under-
dnwn : its entire anatomy lay bn,rG to an inquiring eye, except
where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clust^^ia of
lcg» of beef, mutton, and ham, concealed ib. Above the
cbimuoy were sundiy villainous old guns, and a couple of
lionse-pistcls ; and, by way of ornauient, three gaudily-
punted canisters disposed along its ledge. Tliu floor was of
smooth, white stone j tho cUairs, high-ba^kedj primitive
«lracture«, painted green : one or two heavy black ones
lurking in the shade- In an arch under the dresser reposed
aiiuge. liver-coloured bitch pointer, surrounded by a swarm
of 8f|ucjiling puppies ; and other dogs haunted other recesses.
The apartment and furniture would ha,ve been nothing
citmordinnry as belonging to a liomely, northern farmer,
with a stubborn countenance, and stalwart limbs set out to
ftdnuitage in knee breaches and gaiters. Such an individual
tnted in his arm-chair, his mug of & lo frothing on the
ronnd tablo before him, is to be seen in any circuit of five

WDTHEBING HEIGHTS
to his abode and style of living. He is a dark-skinned gipsy
in Eispect, in dress ajid manners & gentleman ; that is, as
much a gontleman as many a country squire : rather slovenly,
perhaps, yet not looking amiss with hia negligenoe, because
ho has an erect and handsome figure; and rather morose.
Possibly, some people might suspect him of a degree of
under-bred pride ; I have a sympathetic chord " within that
tells me it is nothing of the sort : 1 know, by instinct, hia
reserve springs from an aversion to showy displays 0^|
feeling^to manifestations of mutual kindliness. He'll lov^*
and hate equally under cover, and esteem it a species'of
impertineuce to be loved or hated again. No, I'm running
on too fast : I bestow my own attributes over- liberally on
him. Mr, HeathdiEf may have entirely dissimilar reasons
for keeping his hand out of the way when he meets a would*
be acquaintance! to those which actuate me. Let me hopa
my constitution ia almost peculiar : my dear mother used to
say I should never have a comfortable home ; and oaly
summer I proved myself perfectly unworthy of one.
While enjoying a month of fine weather at the sea-ooastT
I was thrown into the company of a most fascinating
areature : a real goddess in my eyes, as long as she took no
notice of me. I'never told my love'vocally ; stilly if looks
have language, the merest; idiot might have guessed I was
over head and ears : she understood me at last, and looked a
return — the sweetest of all imaginable looks. And what did
I do ? I conies3 it with shame — shi-unk icily into myself,
like a snail ; at every glance retired colder and farther ; till
finally the poor innocent was led to doubt her own sensesi
and| overwhelmed with confusion at her supposed mistako,
persuaded her mamma to decamp. By this curious turn of
disposition I have gained the reputation of deliberate heart-
lessness : how undeserved, I alone can appreciate.
I took a seat at the end of the hearthstone opposite that
towards which my landlord advancedi and filled up an
interval of silence by attempting to caress the canine motb <

'JowphI'
Joeeph mumbled Indistinctly in the depths of the cellar,
but gave no intlmatioa of aBcending ; so his master dived
ilcnm to him, leaving me vis-d-vis tho ruffianly bitch and a
[air of grim shaggy sheep-dogs^ who shared with her &
jsalcus guardianship over all my movements^ Not anxious
k) come Id contact wtth their fangs, I sat still ; but, imagining
they would scarcely understand tacit insults, I unfortmiately
indulged in winking and making faces at the trio, and some
tora of my physiognomy so irritated madam, that sha
Btddeuly broke into a fury and leapt on my kn & BS. I f ung
bar back, and hastened to interpose the table } > Btween us.
This proceeding aroused the whole hive : half-a dozeu four-
footed fields, of various sizes and ages, isBued from hidden
de & fl to the common centre. I felt my heels and coat-lapa
pecnUar subjects of assault ; and parrying off the larger
oombataate as effectuedly as I could with the poker, I was
flOnatrained to demand, aloud, assistance from some of the
liousebold in re-establishing peace.
Mr. Heathcliff and his man climbed the cellar steps with
rexatious phlegm : I don't think they moved one second
faster than usual, though the hearth was an absolute tempest
of worrying and yelping. Happily, an inhabitant of the
Idtcheo made more despatch : a lusty dame, with tucked-up
gown, bare arms, and fire-flushed cheeks, rushed into the
midat of us flourishing a frying-pan : and used that weapon,
aod her tongue, to such pur|yose» that the storm subsided
magicatly, and she only remained, heaving like a sea after a
high wind, when her master entered on the scans,
'^'hat the devil is the matter ?'he asked, eyeing me in a

I bowed and returned the pledge ; bej^nning to perceivqH
that it would be foolish to sit sulking for the tnisHehaviourof^
a pack of curs ; heaides, I felt loth t-o yield the fellow further
ftinHsement at my cxpL-nse ; since his humour took that turn.
He — piobahly swayed by prudential eonsideration of the
tolly of offending a good tenant — relaxed a little in the
laconic style of chippitif^ off hi3 pronouns and uuxiliary verbSf^|
and introduced what he sup^Kised would he a subject cl^l
interest to me, — a discourse on the advantages and dis-
advantages of my present place of retirement. I found him
very int < jlligent on the topics we touched ; and before I went

Being unable to remove tbe chain^ I jumped over, and,

knuckles tingled and tbe dogs howled.
'Wretched inmates 1 * I ejaculated, mentally,'you deserve

The snow began to drive thickly, I seized the handle tO

■ Dnluckiiy, it was a heap of dead rabbits* I hemmed
once more, and drew closer to the hearth, repeating my
comment en the wildness of the evening.
'You. fihould not have come out,'she said, rising and
leaobiDg from the chimney-pioce two of the painted canisters.
Her position before was sheltered from the light ; now,
I b & d ft di & tinct view of her whole figure and countenance.
Slie was slender^ and apparently scarcely past girlhood r an
admirahle form, and the moi^t exquisite little face that I have
ever hiLd the pleasure of l > eholding ; gmall features, very fair ;
flikien ringlets, or rather golden, hanging loose on her
delicate neck ; and eyes, had they been agreeable in expres-
sion, that would have been irresistible ; fortunately for my
susceptible heart, the only sentiment they evinced hovered
between aconi and a kind of desperation, singularly un-
DAtoral to be detected there. The canisters were almost out
of her reach ; I made a motion to aid her ; she turned upon
[D6 aa a miser might turn if any one attempted to aaoist him
in counting his gold.
'I don't want your help,'she snapped ; * I can get them
for myself.'
'I beg your pardon ! * I hastened to reply*
* Were you asked to lea?'she demanded, tying an apron
< nrer her neat black frock, and standing with a spoonful of the
led poised over the pot.
'I shall be glad to have a cup/ I answered.
'Were you asked ?'she repeated,
'No/ 1 sold, half smiling.'You are the proper person to

She flung the tea back, spoon and all, and resumed her
chair in a pet ; her forehead corrugated, and her red under-lip
pushed out, like a child's ready to cry.

Meanwhile, tho young man had slimg on to his person
decidedly shabby up^ier garment, and, erecting himself before "
the blasse^ locked do^^Ti on nie from tho comorof his eyes, for
all the world as it there were somo niortiil feud unavenged
^between us. I began to douljt whether ho wore a servant or
not ; his dress and speech were both rude, entirely devoid of
tho BUpenority observiible in Mr and Mrs, Heathclift; his
thick brown curia were rough and uncultivated, his whiskers
encroached beariahly over his cheeks, and his hands were
embrowned like those of a common labourer : still his
betvring was free, almost haughty, and he showed none of a
domestic's assiduity in attending on the lady of th@ house.
In the absence of clear proofs of his condition, I deemed it
best to abstain from noticing bia curious conduct; and* five
miautes afterwards^ the entrance of HeatihcliS relieved me, h
$ome measure^ from my uncomfortable state.
'You see, sir, I ana come, according to promise
exolaimed, assuming the cheerful;'and I fear I shall be

'Is ^ to have any ?'she asked, appealing to Heathdifil

Get it ready ^ will you?'was the answer, uttered so
vagely that I started. The tone in which the words were
Baid revealed a getiiiine bad nature, I no longer felt inclined
to c & U ribjithclifr a oupilid fellow. Whea the preparations
were finistied, he invited me with —'Now, sir, bring forward

Thia was worse than before : the youth grew crimson,

smothered the storm in a bmtal cufssj muttered on my

He fixed his eye on me longer than I cared to return the

On opening the little door, two hairy monsters flew at my
throat, bearing me down, and extinguishing the light ; while
a mingled gulfaw from Heathcliff and Hareton put the
oopQstone on my rage and humiliation. Fortunately) the
beaBta seemed more bent on atretching their paws, and
yawningf and flourishing their tails^ than devouring me
alive ; but they would suffer no resurrection , and I
forced to lie till their malignant maatera plaased to delivi
me : then, hatless and trembling with wrath^ I ordered the
creants to let me out — ^on their peril to keep me one minu
longer^ with several incoherent threats of retaliation that,
in their indefinite depth of ^iruleney, smacked of King Le
The vehemence of my agitation brought on a copio
bleeding at the nose, and still Heathcliff laughed, and still
scolded, I don't know what would have concluded theseeH'
had there not been one person at hand rather more ratio:
than myself, and more benevolent than my entertaiDer.
This was Zillah, the stout houaewife ; who at length issued
forth to inquire into the nature of the uproar. She thought
that some of them had been laying violent hands on me ;
and, not daring to attack her niai^ter, she turned her vocal
artillery against the younger scoundrel.

With these words she suddenly splashed a pint of icy
water down my neck, and pulled me into the kitchen. Mr.
Heathcliff followed, his accidental merriment expiring
quickly in his habitual moroseness.
I was sick exceedingly, and dizzy, and faint; and ihoB
compelled perforce to accept lodgings under his roof. He
told Zillah to give me a glass of brandy, and then passed on
to the inner room ; while she condoled with me on my
sorry predicament, and having obeyed his orders, whereby I
wftB somewhat revived, ushered me to bed.
CHAPTER m
While leading the wa^y up & tairs^ she recommended that
fihould hide the ca^ndle, und not make & noise ; for her
master had an odd notion about the chamber she would put
me in, and never Jet anybody lodge there willingly. I
asked the reason. She did not know, she answered : she had
only lived thero a yeajr or two ; and they had so many queer
goings on, she could not begin to be curious.
Too stupefied to he curious myself, I fastened my door
and glunced round for the bed. The whole furniture con-
sisted of a chair, a clothes-press, and a large oak case^ with
squares cut out near the top resembling coach windows.
Having approached this structure, I looked inside, and
perceived it to he a singular sort of old-fashioned couch, very
conveniently designed to obviate the necessity for every
member of the family having a room to himself. In f & ct, it
formed a little closet, and the ledge of a window, which it
enclosed, served as a table. I slid back the panelled sides^
got in with my light, pulled them together again, and felt
secure against the vigilance of Heathcliff, and every ooe
else.
The ledge, where I placed mycandlCt had a few mildewed
books piled up in one cornor ; and it was covered with
writing scratched on the paint. This writing* however, was
nothing but a name repeated in all kinds of characters, large
and small — Catherine Eam^hxiw^ here and thera varied to
Catherine HcaOicliff^ and then again to Catherijic Linton.
In vapid lisile & encss I leant my head againt the window,
and continued spelling over Catherine Earnshaw — Heathcli^

well u^d, though not aJtogether for a legitimate purpose :
Aoaroely one chapter had escaped, a pen-and-ink commentary
— at least the appearance of one — covering every morsel of
blank that the printer had left. Some were detached
sentences ; other parta took the form of a rogular diaiy*
scrawled in an unformed, childish hand. At the top of an
extra page (quite a treasure, probably, when fiiit lighted on)
I was greatly Etmused to behold an excellent canoatnre of

of my locality. I thought it was morning ; and I had Bdt
out on my way home, with Joseph for a guide. The sdow
lay yatda deep in our road ; and, as we floundered on. my
companion wearied me with constant reproaches that I had
not brought a pilgrim's staff: telling me that I could never
get into the house without one, and boastfully flourishing a
heavy-headed cudgel, which I understood to be bo denomi^
nated* For a moment I considered it absurd that I should
need such a weapon to gain admittance into my own reaidenoe-

either Joseph, the preacher, or I had committed the'First d

one billowy, white ocean ; the swells and falls not indicat-
ing corresponding rises and depressions in the ground :
many pits^ at least, were filled to a level ; and entire ranges
of mounds, the refuse of the quarries, blotted from the chart
which my yesterday's walk left pictured in my mind. I hod
remarked on one side of the road, at intervals of six or seren
yards, a line of upright stones, continued through the whole
length of the barren : these were erected and daubed with
hme on purpose to serve ae guides in the dark, and also
when a fall, like the present, confounded the deep swamps
on cither hand with the firmer path : but, excepting a dirty
dot pointing up here and there, all traces of their existonoe
had vanished : and my companion found it necessary to
warn me frequently to steer to the right or left, when I
imagined I was followingj correctly, the windings of the
road.
We exchanged little convoraation, and he halted at the
entrance of Thmshcrosg Park, saying, I could make no
error there. Our adieux were limited to a haaty bow, and

mike it four, what with losing myself aujong the trees, and

those who have expeneaced it can appreciate. At any rate,

to mid fro thirty or forty minutes, to restore the animal heat,
I bjjoumed to my study, feeble as a kitten : almost boo

the servant had prepared for my refreshment.

What vain WGa.ther-cocks we are I I, who had determined
to hold myself independent of all social intercourse, and
thanked my stars that^ at length, I had lighted on a epoi
where it was tiexb to iinpraoticabla — I, weak wretch, after
maintaining till dusk a struggle with low spiiitsand solitTide,
was finally compelled to strike my colours ; and under pre-
tence of gaining information concerning the necessities of my
efitablishment, I desired Mrs. Dean, when she brought in

would prove a regular gossip, and either rouse tne to anim%

[ we plagued and wont on with him Bhamefully : for I
m't reasonable enough to foe! my injustico^ and the
[ire^ never put in a word on his behalf when she saw him

He seemed a sullen» patient child ; hardened, perhaps, to
treatment : he would stand Hindley's blows without
iking or shedding a tear, and my pinches moved him only

oaalf by accident, and nobody waH to blame. This endur-

Ih kbe course of time Mr. Eamsbaw be^n to faiL E^ ixad
boen a^^ve and hoaUhy, yet his strength left him suddenly;
and when he was ctinfined to the chimDey-comer he g^w
grievouBly irritjible. A nothing vexed him ; and suspected
Rlighta of bin fvuthority nearly threw him into fits. This w & a
ot([M:ciiilly to be I'^m & rked if any one attempted to iiuposs
uj > oii, or domineer ovefj his favourite: he wits painfully
jutilouH lesti u word should be spoken amiss to him ; eeeiiii^g
to bavo got into his head the notion that, because he liked
HoftthclifT, wXl hated, and longed to do him an ill-turn. I^
wiiH ft disadvantage to the lad; for the kinder among us^^
not wiflh to fret the master, so we humoured his partiality »
and that humouring was rich nourishment to the child- *
pride and black tempers. Still it became in a rnanc*^
iiocoHSary ; twioCj or thrice, Hindley's manifestation of scof^
while his fiitlier was near, roused the old man to a fnry ^^
aoimtl his stick to strike him, and shook with rage that 9^
could not do it, ■
At last, our curate (we had a curate then who made tP'
living anKWor by teaching the little Lintons and EamahaW'^
and fanning hia bit of land himself) advised that the your:^
man Hliould he sent to college ; and Mr. Eamsbaw agree^^
though with a heavy spirit, for he said —'Hindley wt^
nought, and would never thrive as where he wandered.'m
I bttfjcd heartily we should have peace now. It hurt om^
to think the master should he iiiadB uncomfortable by hf ^
own good deed. I fancied the discontent of age and disease

We might have got on tolerably, notwithstanding, but for
fcwo people — Miss Cathy, EUid Joseph, the sen'ant : you saw\
him, I daresay, up yonder. Ho was^ and is yet most likely,
the wearisomest Belf-righteous Pharisee that ever ransacked
a Bible to rake the promises to himaelf and fling the curses
to his neighbours. By hia knack of sermonising and pious
discoursing, be contrived to make a great impression on
Mr, Eamshaw ; and the mors feeble the master became, the
more influenoa he gained. He was relsntlesa in worrying
him about his soul's concerns, and about ruling his chUdreQ
rigidly. He encouraged him to regard Hindley as a repro-
bate; and, night after night, he regularly grumbled out a
loDg string of tale^ again & t Heathclitf and Catherine : always
minding to Matter BamshELw's weakness by heaping the
heaviest blatne on the latter.
Certainly she had ways with her such as I never saw a
child take up before ; aud she put all of us past our patience
fifty tmies and oftener in a day: from the hour she came
down-stairs till the hour she went to bed, we had not a
minute s security that she wouldn't be in mischief. Her
spirits were always at high-water mark, her tongue alwaya
going — singing, laughing, and plaguing everybody who
wouid not do the same, A wild, wicked slip she was — but
I flhe had the bonniest eye, the sweetest smile, and lightest
'loot in the parish : and, after all, I believe she meant no
barm ; for when once she made you cry in good earnest, it
Iiieldom happened tlmt she would not keep you company, and
ptlige you to be quiet that you might comfort her. She waa
'touch too fond of Hoftthcliff. The grentest punishment we
aould invent for her was to keep her separate from him : yet
be got chided more than any of ua on his aocsonnt. In play,
^ liked exceedingly to act the little mistress ; using her
hunds freely, and commanding her companions : she did so
ta me, but I would not bear slapping and ordering ; and so I
lei her know.
Now, Mr. Eamshaw did not understand jokes from his

children : he had alw & ys been slrict and grave with (hem
and Catherine, on her pari, had no idea why her (atfac
should be croesar and less patient in his ailing oonditio
than be waa in his prime. His peevish reproofs wakened icm
her a naiif^hty delight to provoke him : she wns never so
happy as when w© were all scolding her at once, and ^h &
defying as w^th her bold, & aucy lock, and her ready words;
txtming Joseph's religious carsea into ridicule, baiting me,
and doing ju^t what bar father hated moi^t — showing how
her pretended insolence, which he thought real, had more
power over HeatbchCf (ban his kindness * how the hoy would
do her bidding in anylhing, and kU only when it suited bis
own inclination. After hebavitig as b:^y as possible all day,

lying on the floor with his head in her lap. I remember the
master, befoi'e he feU into a doze, stroking her bonny hair —
it pleased him rarely to see her gentle — and saying,'Why

Heathdiff received no floggingi but he was told that the

sible.
CHAPTER Vir
Cathy stayed at Thrushcrpss Grange five weeks: till
ChrlBtmas. By that time her ankle was thoroughly cored,
and her manners much improved. The mistress visited her
often in the interval, and commenced her plan of reform by
trying to raise her self-respect with fine clothes and flattery,
which she took readily ; so that, instead of a wild, hatleas
little savage jumping into the house, and rushing to squeeze
us all breathless, there'lighted from a handsome black pony
a very dignified person, with brown ringlets falling from the
cover of a feathered beaver, and a long cloth habit, whick^
she was obliged to hold up with both hands that she migks^
sail in. Hindley lifted her from her b6rse, ezdaimirv.^
delightedly, * Why, Cathy, you are quite a beauty I I shou^^
scarcely have known you : you look like a lady no^^*

replied his wife:'but she must mind and not grow wil ^

— Stay, dear, you will disarrange your curls — let me unt^^®

I removed the habit, and there shone forth beneath *

judge, in some measurep what grouncU they bad for hoping
to sticceed in separatimg the two friendfl.
Eeathcliff was hard to diacover, & t first If ho were
c%releis5» and uncared for, before Catherine's absence, ha had
been ten times raote so since. Nohody but I even did him
the kindness U > caJI him & dirty boy, and bid him wash
himself, once a week ; ojid childi'en of his age seldom have
a natural pleasure in goap and water. Therefore, not to
nieiition his clothes^ which had seen three rconths'earvice in
tnirB and dust, and his thick uDcombed hair, the surface of
his face and banda was dismally beclouded. He might well
skulk behind tiie settle, on beholding such a bright, graceful
damsel enter the house, instef^ of a rough-headed counter-
^t of himself J as he expected. * Is Heathcliff not here ?'she
demanded, pulling ofE her gloves, and displaying fingers won-
derfully whitened with doing nothing and staying iudoora.
'Heatholiff, you may come forward/ cried Mr, Hindley,
enjoying his discomfituru, and gratified to sGe what a for-
bidding yonug blackguard he would be compelled to present
himaeif.'You may coma and wisli Miss Catherine welcome,
like the other servanta.'
Cathy, catching a glimpse of her friend in his conoeal-
Dt, flew to embrace him ; she bestowed seven or eight
on his cheek within the second, and then stopped, and
wing back, burnt into a laugh, exclaiming,'Why, how
very black and cross you look I and how—how funoy and
grim ! But that's because I'm used to Edgar and laabella
Linton. WeU, Heathcliff, have you forgotten me ?'
She had some reason to pub the question, for shame and
pride threw doable gloom over his countenance, and kept
him immovable,
'Shake hands^ Heathcliff,'said Mr. Earnshaw, cott-
ndiugly ;'once in a way, that is permitted/
I shall not/ replied the boy, finding his tongue at last;
'I shall not stand to be laughed at* I shall not bear it !'
And he would have broken from the circle, but Misg
Catby salted him again.

She gazed concernedly at the dusky fingers she held id
her own^ and alao at her dress ; which she feared had gaiued
no embellishment from its contact with his.
'You needn't have touched me !'he answered, following
her eye and gnatohing away his hand. * I shall be as £r^'
as I please : and I like to be dirty, and I will be dirty/
With that he dashed headforemost out of the room, amid
the merriment of the master and mistress, and to the serious
diaturbance of Catherine ; who could nob comprehend how
her remarks should have produced such an exhibition of bad
temper*
After playing lady's-maid to ihe new-comer, and putting
my cakes iu the oven, and making the house and kitchen
cheerful with great fires, befitting Christmas*eve, I prepared
to sit down and amuse myself by singing caixkls, aU alone;
regardless of Joseph's affirmations that he considered the
merry tuues I chose as next door to songs. He had retired
to private prayer in his chamber^ and Mr. and Mrs. Earn-
abaw were engaging Missy's attention by sundry gay trifles
bought for her to pre & ent to the little Lintons, as an acknow-
ledgment of their kindness. They had invited them to spend
the morrow at Wuthering Heights, and the iuvitation had
been accepted, on one condition : Mrs. Linton begged that
her darlings might be kept caiefuUy apart from that'naughty
swearing boy.'
Under the^ circumstances I remained solitary. I smelt
the rich scent of the heating spices ; and admired the shining
kitchen utousils, the poli & hed clock, decked in holly, the
silver mugs ranged on a tray ready to be tilled with mailed
ale for supper; and above ail, the speckless purity of my par-
ocular care^the scoured and weU-swopt floor. I gave due
inward applause to every object, and then 1 remembered

how old Eomshaw used to come in wh^n all was bididdj
Rod edl me a cant lass, and slip a shilling into my hand ag
» Christmas-box ; and from that I wenfe on to think of his
EoodnaBS for HeathclifT, and his dread le & t he should su^er
neglect after death hiid removed him : and that UBiturally
bd nw to consider the poor liid's situation now, tind from
singing I changed my mind to crjing. It atruck in & soon,
however, there would be more aense in endeavouring to
repair some of his wrongs than shedding tearg over them : I
got up and walked into the court to seek him. He was not
kr ; I found him smoothing the glossy coat of the new pony
in llie atable, and feeding the other beaat & , according to custom.
'Muke haste, HeathcliGf I'I aaid,'the kitchen is so
ooDafortable ; and Joaeph is up-stalrs : make haste, Mid let
me dress yoti sm^irt before Miss Cathy comes out, tuid then
you can ait together, with the whole hearth to yourselves,
and have a long chatter till bedtime/
He proceeded with his task, and never turned his head
towards me.
• Come — ajre you coming ?'I continued,'There's a little
e & ke for each of you, nearly enough ; and you'll need half-an-
hour's donning/
I waited & ve minutes, but getting no answer left him.
Catherine supped with her brother and Bister-in-law : Joseph
aod I joined at an unsociahle meal, seasoned with reproofs on
one side and sauciness on the other. His cake and cheese
feouuned on the table all night for the fairies. He
maoaged to continue work till nine o'clock, and then
marched dumb and dour to his chamber. Cathy sat up
late, having a world of things to order for the recep-
tion of her new friends : she came into the kitchen once to
speak to her old one ; but he was gone, and she only stayed
to aek what was the noatter with him, and then went hack,
the morning he rose early ; and, as it was a holiday, carried
ill-humour on to ibe moors; not re-appeai'ing till the
tily were departed for church. Pasting and reflection
seemed bo hare brought him to »• better spirit. He bung

about me far a while» £Lnd having screwed np his courage,
exclaimed abruptly—'Nelly, make me decent, Vva going to
be good.'
'High time, HeathcUff,* I said ; * you huve grieved
Catherine : she's sorry she ever came home, I daresay I It
looks as if you envied her, hecauae she is more thought of tbaa
you/
The notion of envying Catherine was incompieheasible
to him^ but the notion of grieving her he understood cleiarlyf
enough. V
* Did she aay she was grieved ?'he inquired, looking very
senous.
'She ciied when I told her you were off again this
morning/
'Wellj I cried last night/ he returned, * and I had moi
reason fcc ciy than she/
'Yes : you had the reason of going to bed with a proud'
heart and an empty stomach/ said I.'Proud people breed
BSrii sorrows for themselves. But, if you be ashamed of your
touchiness, yon must ask pardon, mind, when she comes in.
You must go up and offer to kiss her, and say^ — you know
best what to say; only do it heartily, and not as if yon
thought her converted into a stranger by htsr grand dress.
And now, though I have dinner to get ready, I'll steal time
to arrange you bo that Edgar Linton shall look quite a doll
beside you : and that he does. You are younger, and yet,
1*11 be bound, you are taller and twice as hroad across the
shoulders ; you could knock bim down in a twinkling ; donV
you feel that you could ?'
Heathcliff's face brighten & d a moment ; then it was
east afresh, and he sighed.
^ But, Nelly, if I knocked him down twenty times, that
wouldn't make him less handsome or me more so. I wish I
had light hair and a fair skin, and was dressed and behaved
as well, and had a chance of being as Hoh as he will be \'

to^se your lids frankly, and change the fiends to confideutt
imtocent angels, suspecting and doubting nothing, and
Uwaya seeing friends where they are not sure of foes. Don't
gel the expression of a vicious cur that appears to know the
kicks it gets are its desert, and yet hates all the world, as weU
m the kicker, for what it suffers.'
'lo other words, I must wish for Edgar Linton's great
blue eyea and eTsn forehead/ he rephed. *I do^and that
won't help me to them.'
'A good heart will help you to a bonny face, my lad/ I
oontiimed,'if you were a regular black ; and a bad one will
torn the boiinieat into something worse than ugly. And now
:hat we've done washing, and cornhing, and sulking — tell me
whether yon don't think yourself rather handsome? I'll

saibis Kud brought to England. Were I in your place, I
ivocdd frame high notions of my birth ; and the thoughts of
what I was should give me courage and dignity to support
the oppressions of a little farmer !'
So I chattered on ; and Heathcliff " grurdually lost hia
frown and began to look quite pleasant, when all at onee
our conversation was interrupted by a rumbling sound
moving up the road and entering the court. He ran to the
window and I to the door, just in time to behold the two

I urged my companion to hasten now and show his

would have it that, sa he opened the door leading from the
kitchen on one side, Hindley opened it on the other. They

'Nay, air,'I could not avoid answering,'he'll touch

'He shall have his share of my hand, if I catch him

He ventured this remark without any intention to insult;
but HeathcUffs violent nature was not prepared to endure
the appearance of impertinence from one whom he seemed to
hate, even then, as a rival. He seized a tureen of hot apple
sauce (the first thing that came under his gripe) and dashed
it full against the speaker's face & nd neck ; who instantly
oommeuced a lament that brought Isabella and Catherine
hurrying to the place. Mr. Earnshaw snatched up ih©

ptSBioo, for he appeared red and breathless. I gt > t the diah-

jffinning it served him right for mediUi%f. His sister began
weeping to go home, and Cathy stocMj by confounded, btush-

*You should not have spoken to him I'she expostulated

The little party recovered its equanimity at eight of ths

coQBoted, since no real harm had befallen them. Mr.

wearying to find an opportunity of getting by herself, or pay-

Ja the evening we had a da^uce. Cathy begged tha6 he
might be liberated then, as Isabella Linton had no partner:
hor entreaties were vain, and I waa appointed to supply the
doficieucy. We got rid of all gloom in the excitement < A

arrival of fche Gimmerton band, mustering fifteen strong ;
a trumpet, a trombone, clarionets, bassoons, French horns,
and a bass viol, besides aingera. They go the rounds of all
the respectable houses, and reoeive contributions evsif
Christmas, and we esteemed it a first-rate treat to hear them.
After the usual carols had been sung, we set them tosong)^

Catherine loved it too : but she said it soutided sweetest
at the top of the steps, and she went up in the darkt i
followed. They shut the house door below, never noting oiir
absence, it was so full of people. She made no stay at tb©

Heathcliff was confined, and called him. He stubbornly
declined answering for a while: she persevered, and ficallv'
persuaded him to hold communion with her through the?
boards. I let the poor things converse unmolested, till I
supposed the songs were going to cease, and the singers IC
get some refreshment ; then I clamljered up the lewider i^

Mrs, Doan meed the candle, and I discerned a aoft-
leUurcd faco, exceedingly resembling the young lady at (he
Heights, but moie pensive and amiable in expression. It
fonned a sweet picture. The long light hair curled slightiy
on the temples ; the eyes were large and serious ; the figure
almost too graceful, I did not marvel how Catherme
Earufihaw eould forget her first fiiend for such an individual.
1 marvelled much how he, with a mind to correspond with
bu person, could fancy my idea of Gathenne Eamshaw.

not artful, never played the coquette, and had evidently an

HeathcJiff expressed contempt of Lijiton in his presence, she

Linton evinced disgust and antipathy to Heathcliff, she
dared not treat his sentiments with indifference, as if
depreciation of her playmate were of scarcely any oon-
sequence to her^ I've had many a laugh at her perplexttiee
and untold troubles, which she vainly strove to hide from

she should be chastened into more humility. She did bring

Mr. Hindiey had gone from home one afternoon, ftti^
Heathcliff presumed to give himself a holiday on the strength

repulsiveneBa that his present aspect retains no ti^ces ol
In the first place, he had by that time lost the benefit of hi
early education : continual hard work, begun soon an
concluded late, had extinguished any curiosity he one
posfleBsed in pursuit of knowledge, and any love for books t
learning. His childhood's sense of superiority, instilled m\
him by the favours of old Mr, Earnshaw, was faded awa "
He struggled long to keep up an equality with Catherine i
her studies, and yielded with poignant though silent regnei
but he yielded completely; and there was no prevailing on hli

Hush^ child, hush ! Well then, it is my darling ! wiaht, dry

Poor Hareton was squalling and Idcking in his faitier's
arms with all his might, and redoubled his yells when he
cai'ried him up-stairs and lifted him over the banister, I
cried out that be would fiighten the child into fits» and ran
to rescue him. As I reached them, Hindley leant for^;t.*ard
on the rails to listen to a noise below ; almost forgetting what
he had in his hands.'Who is that ?'he asked, hearing
some one approaching the stairs'- foot. I leant forward also,
for the pui'pose of signing to Heathchff, whose step I recog-
nised, not to come further ; and, at the instant when my
eye quitted Hareton, he gave a sudden spring* delivered
himself from the careless grasp that held him, and lell.
There was scarcely time to experience a thrill of horror
before we saw that the little wretch was safe. Heathcltfif
ariived underneatli just at the cntical moment ; by a natural
impuke he arrested his descent, and setting him on his feet,
looked up to discover the author of the accident. A miser
who has parted with a lucky lottery ticket for five shillings,
and finds next day ha has lost in the bargain five thousand
pounds, could not show a blank & r countenance than he did
on beholding the figure of Mr. Earnshaw above. It ex-
pressed, plainer than words could do, the intenaest anguish at
having made himself tlio instrument of thwai^ting his own

'I never sii^w HealhcLiflf last night,'answered Catherine,
heginning to sob bitterly : * and if you do turn him out of
doors, III go with him. But, perhaps, you'U never have an
oppoilunity ; perhaps, he's gone.'Here she burst bto
uncontrollablt) grief, and the remainder of her words were
inarticulate »
Bindley lavished on her a torrent of scornful abase, ac^
bade her get to her room immediately, or she shouldn't cry
for nothing I I obliged her to obey ; and I shall never
forget what a scene & hc acled when we reached her chamber:
it terriBed me. J thought she was going mad, ^nd I begged
Joseph to run for the doctor. It proved the commenoe'
ment of delinum : Mr. Kenneth, as soon as he saw h^,
pronounced her daageroualy ill ; she bad a fever* He btijd
her^ and he told me to let her live on whey and water-grueL
and take c^are she did nob thi'ow herself downstairs or out of
the window ; and then he left : for he had enough to do \ti
the parish, where two or three miles was the ordinary disUact
between cottage and cottage.
Though I cannot say I made a gentle nurBe, and JcAepb
and the master were no better, and though our patient was
as wearisome and headstrong as a patient could be, & ba
weathered it through. Old Mrs. Linton paid ua several
visits, to be sure, and set things to rights, and scolded so^
ordered us all ; and when Catherine was convaldsceut, she
insisted on conveying her to Thrashcross Grange: lor
which deliverunce we were very gmteful. But the poor
dame had reason to repent of her kindness : she and btf
husband both took the fever, and died within a few days & (
each other.
Our young lady returned to us saucier ajid more pas-
Bionate, and hjiughtier than ever. Heathcliff had never been
heard of since the evening of the thunder-storm ; and, od8
day, I had (he misfortune, when she had provoked cos
exceedingly, lo lay tiie blame of his diaiippearance on her:

ienielf a woman, and our mistreesi and thought thett her
Kt Ulnosd gave her a claim to be treated with considera-
. Then the doctor had said that she would not bear
roesing much ; she ought to have her own way ; and it was
lothing lees thidu murder in her eyes for any one to presume
ostandupand contradict her. From Mr. Eamshaw and
is companions she kept aloof ; and tutored by Kennethp
od serious threats of a fit that often attended hor mges^ her
rather allowed her whatever she pleased to demand, and
enerally avoided aggravating her fiery temper. He was
fcther too indulgent in humouring her capricea ; not from
ffection, but Irom pride : ho \viahod earnestly to aoe her

ave been before and will be after hiuip was infatuated : and
elieved himself the happiest man alive on tlie day he led her

Bath.
Much against my inclination, I was persuaded to leave
Vatbering Heights and accompany her here. Little Hare-
an waa nearly five years old^ and I had just begun to teach
lim his letters. We made a sad parting; but Catherine's
ears were more powerful than ours. When I refused to go,
lid when she found her entreaties did not move me, she
rent lamenting to her husband and brother. The former
'ffered me munificent wages ; the latter ordered me to pack

liere was no mistress ; and as to Hareton, the curate should
ibke him in hand, by-and-by. And so I had but one choice

I got Miss Catherine and myself to Thrushcross Grange ;
and, to my agreeable disappointment, she behaved infinitely
better than I dared to expect. She seemed almost over-fond
of Mr. Liinton ; and even to his sister she showed plenty of
affection. They were both I'ery attentive to her comfort,
certainly. It was not the tho n bending to the honeysuckles,
but the honeysuckles embracing the thorn. Ther© wejie no

baftket of apples which I had been gathering. It had got
duak, and tlie moon lc»oked over the high wall of the court,
fusing undefin & d shadows to lurk in the corners of the
numerotas projecting portions of the building. I Bet my
burden on the house-steps by the kjtchen-doori and lingered
boreet, and drew in a few more breaths of the soft, sweet
wr ; my eyes were on the moon, and my back to the
enUikDcer when I heard a voice behind me say, —'Nelly, is
tlut you V'
It was a deep voice, and foreign in tone ; yet there was
something in the manner of pronouncing niy name which
made it sound famibar, I turned about to discover who
apoko^ fearfully ; for the doora were shut, and I had seen
nolxxiy on approaching the steps. Something stirred la
the porch ; and, moving nearer, I distinguished a tall man
dressed in dark clothes, with dark face and hair. Ho leant
against the side, and held his fingers on the latch as if in-
tending to open for himself.'Who can it be?'I thought.

A ray fell on his features ; the cheeks were nllow, and

eyes deep-set and singular. I remembered the eyes.

worldly visitor, and I raised my hands in amawnffini
'What 1 you come back ? Is it really you ? Is it ?'

He lifted the latch, and I entered ; but when I got to ihe
parlour where Mr. and Mrs. Linton were, I could not
persuade myself to proceed. At length I resolved on
making an excuse to ask if they would have the candlei
lighted, and I opened tlie door.
They sat together in a window whose lattice lay bidk
against the wall, and displayed, beyond the garden tieeB.
and the wild green park, the valley of Gimmerton, with %
long line of mist winding nearly to its top (for very sooa
after you pass tlie chapel, as you may have noticed^ the
sough that runs from the marshes joins a beck which foUom

ushered him into the presence of the master and miatreaa
whose flushed cheeka betrayed signs of warm talMng. Bu'
the lady's glowed with another feeling when her frieac
appeared at the door: she sprang forward, took both bi)
hands, and led him to Linton ; and then she seized Linlon'i
reluctant fingers and crushed thLriii into his. Now, fuUj
revealed by the fire and candlelight, I was amazed, mon
than ever, to behold the transform ation of HeiithdlifT. Hi
had grown a tall, athletic, well-formed man ; beside whoQ
my master seemed quite slender atid youth -like. Hia op
right carriage suggested the idea of his having been in lb
army. His countenance was much older in expression 4
decision of feature than Mr. Linton's ; it looked intelligevl
and retained no marks of former degradation. A bill
civilised ferocity lurked yet in the depressed brows m

was even dignified : quite divested of roughness, though to

'Aod I also/ answered Heathcliff, * especially if it be

Ho took a seat opposite Catherine, who kept her gaze
fixed on liim as if she feared he would vanish were she to
remove it. He did nob raise bis to her often ; a quick glance
now and then suBiced ; but it dashed back, each time more
confidently, the undisguised delight he drank from hers.
They were too much absorbed in their mutual joy to suffer
fljnbarrasament. Not so Mr. Edgar : be grew pale with pure
annoyance: a feeling that reached its climax when his lady
rose, and stepping across the nig, seized Heathcliirs hands

and I'm thirsty.'
She took her post before the urn ; and Miss IsabellA
cjam6| summoned by the hell ; then* having banded thdr
chairs forsvard, I left the room. The meal hardly eudorsd
ten minutes. Catheiine's cup was never filled : she could
neither eat nor drink, Edgar had made a slop in his Banoefj
and scarcely swallowed a mouthful. Their guest did not
protract his stay that evening ahovo an hour longer. I askedi
as he departed, if he went to Giinmerton ?
* No, to Wuthering Heights/ he answered :'Mr* Eiim-

he consented. Hindlcy is too roeklesa to select hig acquEiint-
ance prudently : he doesn't trouble himself to reflect on the
causeB he might have for mistrusting one whom he has
basely injured. But Heathcliff affinns his principal reason
for resuming a connection wth hia ancient persecutor is a
wish to LnatH.1 himself in quarters at walking distance Itom
the Grange, and an attachment to the houae where we lived
together ; and likewise a hope that I shall have more
opportunities of seeing him there than I could hare if hi^|
settled in Gimmerton. He means to ofifer liberal payment^
for permission to lodge at the Heights ; and doubtless my

In this aelf'Complacent conviction she departed ; and the
sucoesB of hor fulIiLled resolution was obvious on the morrow:
Mr. Linton had not only abjured hia peevishneaa (though hia
ts seemeid »till subdued by Catherine's exuberance of
vacity)^ but he ventured no objeclioD to her taking Isabella
with hiir to Wuthering Heights in the afternoon ; and she
rewarded him with such a. Rummer of sweotnossand affection
in return as made the house a paradise for several days;
both master and Ber\'antB profiting from the peipetual Bun-
ghioe.
Heathcliff — Mr, Heathcliff I should say in future — U8©d
the liberty of visiting at Thrushorosa Grange cautiously^ at
first : he seemed estimating how far its owner would bear
his intrusion. Cathenno, also, deemed it judicious to
moderiUe her expressions of ploasure in receiving him ; and
he gra < luji.ny estiihlished his right to bo expected. He
PBiained a great deal of tlie rcKcivo for which his boyhood
was i-emarkable; and that served to repress all startling

experienced a lull, and further circumBtancea diverted it into

Hi* new source of trouble sprang from the not anticipated
misfortune of Isabella Linton evincing a sudden and irresist-
ible aitra-ction towards the tolerated guest. She was at that
time a charming young lady of eighteen ; infantile in
loanners, though possessed of keen wit, keen feelings, and a
keen temper, too, if irritated. Her brother, who loved her

tenderly, was n-ppallcd at this fantastic preferonce* Lea
aside the degriidation of nn alliance with a nameless man,
and the possible fact tb & t his property, in default of heirs
male, might pasa into Euch a ono^s power, he had sense to
comprehend HeathclifTs disposition ; to know that, though
his exterior was altered, bis mind was unchangeable and
unchanged. And he dreaded that mind ; it revolted him :
ho ahrank forebodingly from the idea of committing IsalKslla
to its keeping. He would have recoiled still more bad ho
been awnre that her attachment rose unsolicited, and was
bestowed where it awakened no reciprocation of sentiment ;
for the minute he discovered its existence he laid the hlEime
on Heathcliff's deliberate designing.
We htwl all remarked, during some time, that Miss Linton
fretted and pined over something. She grew cross and
wearisome; snapping at and teasing Catherine continually,
at the imminent risk of exhausting her limited patinnce. We
excused her, to a certain extent, on the plea of Hi-health :
she was dwindling and fading before our eyes. But one day,
when she had been peculiarly wayward, rejecting
breakfast, compkining that the servants did not do what
told them ; that the mistress would allow her to l > e nothing
in the housie, and Edgar neglected her ; that she had caught a
cold with the doors being left open^ and wo let the parlour
fire go out on purpose to vex her, with a hundi^ed yet more
frivolous accusations, Mrs. Linton peremptorily insisted that
she should get t-o bed ; and^ having scolded her heartily^
threatened to send for the doctor. Mention of Kenneth
caused her to exclaim, instantly, Uiat her health was perf
and it was only Catherine's harshness which made
unhappy.
'How can you say I am harsh, you naughty fondling ? *
cried the mistress, amazed at the uniBasonahle assertion.

the former, on mature consideration, really oftendfid with
her companion ; and, if she laughed again at her pertness,
inclined to mako it no laughing matter to her. She did
laugh ofi she saw HeathcUtf piiBS the window. I wad

that as fast as she raised one finger off her arm another

that I had little faith in her principles, and still less
sympathy for her feelings. I wanted something to happen
which might have the effect of freeing both Wuthering
Heights and the Grange of Mr. Heathdiff, quietly ; leaving
us as we had been prior to his advent. His visits were a
continual nightmare to me ; and, I suspected, to my master
also. His abode at the Heights was an oppression past
explaining. I felt that God had forsaken the stray sheep
there to its own wicked wanderings^ and an evil beast prowled
between it and the fold, waiting his time to sining and
destroy.

CHAPTER XI
SoHRTrMES, while meditating on these things in solitnde,
got up in a sudden tenor, and put on my boDuet to
see how all waa at the farm. I've pBrauaded my cooscieu
that it was a duty to warn him how people talked rega
his ways ; and then I've recollected his confirmed bad
habits, and, hopeless of benefiting him, have flinched from
re-entering the dismaJ house, doubting if I could bear to
taken at tny word.
One time I passed the old gate^ going out of my way» oii
a journey to Gimmerton. It waa about the period that my
narrative haa reached ; a bright frosty afternoon ; the ground
bare^ and the road hard and diy. I came to a stona whe^
the highway branches off on to the moor at your left han^
a rough aand-pillar^ ^vith the letters W. H. cut on its north
Bide, on the east, G,, and on the south-west, T. G- It serves
as a guide-po & t to the Grange, the Heights, and village. The
sun shone yellow on its grey bead, reminding me of summer ;
and I cannot say why^ but all at once a gush of child^a
sensations flowed into my heart. Hindley and I held it a
favourite spot twenty years before. 1 gazed long at the
weather-worn block ; and, stooping down, perceived a hole
near the bottom still full of snail-shells and pebbles^ whid|
we were fond of storing Ihere with more penshable thing^
and, as fresh as reality, it appeared that I beheld my early
playmate seated on the withered turf ; his dark, square bei
bent forward, and his little hand ficooping out the earth
a piece of slate.'Poor Hindley 1'I exclLuimed, involufl'
tarily. I started ; my bodily eye was cheated into a

perstition urged me to comply with this impulse : sup-
posing he should be dead 1 I thought — or should die soon I
—supposing it were a sign of death I The nearer I got to
the houae the more agitated I grew ; and on catching sight
of it I trembled in every limb. The apparition had out-
stripped me : it stood looking through the gate. That wag
my firat idea on observing an eU-Iocked* brown-eyed boy
setting his ruddy conntenance against the bars. Further
reflection suggested this must be Harston, mrj Hareton, not
altered greatly since I left him, ten months since.
* God bless theo, darUng !'I cried, forgetting instan-
timeously my foolish fears. * Hareton, it's Nelly I NeUy, thy

flint.
'J am come to see thy father, Hareton/ I added, guessing
from the action tha^t Nelly, if she lived in his memory at all,
was not recognised as one with me.
He raised his missile to burl it ; I commenced a aoothing
speech, bat could not stay his hand : the stone struck my
bonnet ; and then ensued^ from the stammering lips of the
little fellow, a string of cmses, which, whether ho compre-
heuded them or not, were delivered with practised emphasis,
and distorted his baby features into a shocking expresaion of
malignity. You may be certain this grieved more than
angered me. Fit to cry, I took an orange from my pocket,
and offered it to propitiate him. Ho hesitated, and then
utatclied it from my hold ; as if he fancied I only intended
to tempt and disappoint him, I showed another, keeping it
out of his reach.
'Who has taught you those fine words, my bairn ?'I
inqiured.'The curate ?'

jjrevent it, he laid hia hand on her arm. She averted her
€ & ce : he apparently put some question which ghe had no
ximd to answer. There waa another rapid glance at the
louaef and supposing himself unseen^ the scoundrel bad the
impudence to embrace her.
'Judas ! Traitor I'I ejaculated. * You are a hypocrite,

I had been over-intent on watching the pair outside to

the garden ; and a minute after, HeatliclifF opened the door >
I couldn't TA-ithhold giving some loose to my indignation ; but
Catherine angrily insisted on silence, and thi'eatened to

growing intractable : she could ncnUnjr lay nor control it.

the whole subsequent dispute. I fancied it could not be
very prejudicial to Mrs. Linton : unless she made it so after-
wards, by assuming the defensive for her guest. Edgar
Linton had difficulty in hearing me to the close. His first
words revealed that he did not clear his wife of blame.

'Neither,'replied I ;'if you mean Mr. Linton* He's

She could not bear the notion which I had put into her

ported on one arm, and not noticing my refusal to obey her,
she seemed to find childish diversion in pulling the feathera

He had only then come from the library ; and, in passing
through the lobby, had noticed our talking and been attracted
by curiosity, cr fear, to examine what it signified, aLthatlatj

Mrs. Linton's illuGsa might have arrested her rash step. Bat
what could be done now? There was a bare posaibilicy of
overtaking them if puraued inetantly. I could not pnisne
them, however; and I dared not rouse the family, and fill
the plaoe with confusion ; still less unfold the business to
my master, absorbed as he was in his present caJamity, and
having no heart to apars for a seoond grief I I saw nothing
for it but to hold my tongue, and suffer matters to take th > Bir

CHAPTER Xm
Fob two months the fngitivea retuained absent ; in tho & e two
montbSr Mrs. Linton encountGred and conquered the worat
Bhock of what wixa denominated a brain fever. No naother
oould have nui*sed an only child more devotedly than Edgar
tended her. Day and night he was watching, and patiently
enduring all the annoyances that irritable nerros and a
shaken reason could inflict ; and, though Kenneth remarked
that what he saved from the grave would only recompense
his eare by forming the Boarce of constant future anxiety™
in fact^ that his hea.Lth and strongth were Using socriiiced to
presen-e a mere ruin of humanity — he knew no limits in
gratitude and joy when Catherine'fl life was declared out of
danger ; and hour after hour he would sit beside her, tracing
^e gi'odual return to bodily health, and flattering his too
sanguine hopes with the illusion tliat her mind would settle
bwjk to its right balance also, and she would soon be entirely
her former self.
The first time she left her chamber was at the commence-
ment of the following March. Mr. Linton had pub on her
pillow, in the morning, a handful of golden crocuses ; her
eye, long stranger to any gleam of pleasure, caught them in
waking, and shone delighted as she gathered them eagerly
together.
• These are the earliest flowers at the Heights/ she ex-
claimed-'They remind me of soft thaw winds, and warm
sunshine, and nearly melted snow. Edgar, ia there not a
aouth wind, and is not the snow almost gone ?'
'The snow ts quite gone down hei " ej darling,'replied her
140
WUTHERING HEIGHTS
f husband ;'and I only see two wkite spots on the whole
r & nige of moors : the sky is blue, and ihe larks are aingingf
and the becks and brooks are a.U brim fall. Catherine, bist
spring at thb time, I was longing to have you under this
roof ; now, I wi & h you were a mile or two up those hilla :
the air blows so sweetly, I fee! that it would cure you-'
'I shall never be there but once more,* said the invalid ;
• and then you'll leave me, and I shall remain forever. Next
spring you'll long again to bare me under thia roof, and you*U
look back and think you were happy to-day.'
Linton lavished on her the kindest caresses, and tried to
cheer her by the fondest words ; but, vaguely regarding tbe
flowers, she let the teara eollect on her taahea and stream down
her cheeks unheeding. We knew she was really better,
and, therefore^ decided that long confinement to a single place
produced much of this despondency, and it might be partially
removed by a change of scene. The master told me to light
a £re in the many-weeks'deserted parlour, and to set an
easy-chair in the sunsbiue by the window; and then he
brought her down, and ehe sat a long while enjoying the
genial heat, and, as we expected, revived by the objects round
her : which, though familiar, were free from the dreary asso-
ciations investing her hated sick chamber. By evening shd
seemed ^eatly exhausted ; yet no arguments could p^suadQ
her to return to that apartment, and I had to arrwige tho
parlour sofa for her bed, till another room could be prepared,^
To obviate the fatigue of mounting and descending tbe & tairSy
we fitted up this, where you lie at present — on the same floor
with the parlour ; and she was soon strong enough to move
from one to the other, leaning on Edgar's arm. Ah, I
thought myaelf, she might recover, so waited on as ^he was.
And there was double cause to desire it, for on her existence
depended that of another: we cherished the hope that in a
little while Mr. Linton's heart would be gladdened, and his
lauds secured from a stranger's gripe, by tbe-j & irlli of an beir*
I should mention that Isabella sent to her brother, some
six weeks from her departure, a short note, announcing her

and an entreaty for kind remembr & ace and reconciliation, if
bar proceeding had oSe^dad him : asserting that she could not

morep I got a long letter, which I considered odd, ooming from
the pen of a bride just out of the honeymoon. I'll read it :

only choice left me is you.

that my heart returned to Thruahoroes Grange in twenty-
four hours after I left it, and is there at this moment, full of
warm feelings for him, and Catherine I / can't follow it

me, and they may draw what conclusions they please ; taking
care, however^ to lay notiiing at the door of roy weak will or
deficient affection.
The remainder of tha letter is for yourself alone- I want
to afik you two questions : the first is, — How did you con-
trive to preserve the common sympathies of human nature
when you resided here ? I cannot recognise any sentiment
which those around share with me.
The second question I have great interest in ; it is this—;
la Mr, HeathcUff a man ? If so, is he mad? And if not, is
he a devil? I sha'n't tell my reasons for making this
inquiry ; but I beseech you to explain^ if you can, what I
have married: that ia, when you call to see me; and you
muBt call, Ellen, very soon. Don't write, but come, and

The sun set behind the Grange as we turned on to th

elevate his torch to a level ^vith my face, squint aialignautly
pioject his under-lip, and turn away. Then he took the two
horses, and led them into the stables; reappearing for the
purpose of Itxskingthe outer gnte, as if we lived in an aucieot

HeathclifT stayed to speak to him, and I eniered tbe

I waliced round the yard, and through a wtcket, to another

icet in masses of sltaggy hair that hung on his shoulders ;
and his eyes, too, were like a ghostly Catherine's with all

my future host, searching the darkness beyond me in

have done had the * fiend'deceived him.
I repeated having tried this second entr & noe, and was
almost inclined tq slip a%vay before he finished cursings but
ere I oould execute that intension, he ordered me in, and
shut and re-fastened the door. There WEts a ^eat fire, and
that was ail the light in the huge apartment^ whose floor heA
grown a uniform grey ; and the onoe brilliant pewter-dishes,
which used to attract my gaze when I was a girl, partook of
a similar obscurity, created by tarnish and dust. I inquired
whether I might call the maid, and be oonducted to a
bedroom I Mr. Eanishaw vouchsafed no answer. He
walked up and down, with hia hands in his pockets, appar-
ently quite forgetting my presence : and his abstraction was
evidently so deep, and hia whole aspect so misanthropical,
that I shrank from disturbing him again.
You'll not be surprised, Ellen, at my feeling particularly
cheerless, seated in worse than solitude on that inhospitable
hearthj and remembering that four miles distant lay my
dehghtful home, containing the only people I loved on earth ;

Bpcke audibly in irrepresaiblo sighing and weeping. I was
not aware how ojjeuly I grieved, till Eamahaw halted
opposite, in his measured walk, and gave me a stare of newly-

drapery to trail upon the floor. The chaim were aUo
damaged, many of them severely ; and deep indectationa
deformed the piineia of the walls. I was endeavouring to

collecting the shattered earthenwarej and drying the Bp & ttera
of milk from the banister with my pocket-handkerchief. Our
labours were scarcely over when I heard Eamahaw's tread Id
the passage ; my asdst^nt tucked in his tail, and pressed to
the wall ; I stole into the nearest doorway. The dog'i
endeavour to avoid him was unsucoessful ; as I guessed l^y &
scutter down- & tairs, and a prolonged, piteoua yelping. I hU
better luck : he passed on, entered his chamber, and shut the

CHAPTEB Sr7
As goon as I had peraaed this epistle I went to the miLRter,
and informed him that hia sister had arrived at the Heights^
and sent me a letter expressing her sorrow for Mrs. Linton's
Bituation, and her ardent desire to see him ; with a. wish that
he would transmit to her, as early as poasihle, some bokanof
forgiveness by me.
'Forgiveneaa 1'said linton*'I have nothing to forgive
her, Ellen. You may call at Wuthering Heights this after-
noon, if you like, a,nd say that I am not ang-rt/^ but Fm Aorry

'And you won't write her a little note, sir ?'I asked,

Mr, Edgar's coldness depressed me exceedingly ; and all
the way from the Grange I puzzled my brains how to put
more heart into what he said, when I repeated it ; and how
to soften his refusal of even a few lines to console Isabella.
I daresay she had been on the watch for me since morning :
I saw her looking through the lattice as I came up tha

back, as if afraid of being observed. I entered ^thout

But» at last, I think she begins to know me : I don't
perceive the silly smiles and grimjw^es that provoked me at

discover that I did not love her. I believed^ at one time, no
lessons could teach her that ! And yet it is poorly learnt ;
for this morning she announced, as a piece of appalling
intelligence^ that I had actually succeeded in making her

it be ELchieved, I havo cause to return thanks. Can I tnisi
your assertion, Isabella ? Are you sure you hate me ? If I
lei you alone for half a day, won't you come sighing and

seemed all tenderness before you : it wounds her vanity to
have the truth exposed* But I don't care who knows thai
the passion was wholly on one side'and I never told her a
lie about it. She cannot accuse me of showing one bit. of
deceitful softness- The first thing she saw me do, on
coming out of the Grange, was to hang up her Ottle dog ;

Burpriaing her, I don't desire it : you musb prepare her— aek

mention me if I n,m a forbidden topic in the house? She
thinfca you are all spies for her husband. Oh, IVe no doubt
she's in hell among you 1 I guess by her silence, as much as
anything^ what she feels. You say she is often restlesR^ and
anxious-looking: is that a proof of tranquillity? YouttJkof

her to vigour in the soil of his shallow cares ? Let us settle
it at once : will you stay here, and am I to fight my way to
Catherine over Linton and his footman ? Or will you be my
friend, as you have been hitherto, and do what I nequest?
Decide I because there is no reason for my lingering another
minute, if you persist in your stubborn ill-nature 1'
Well, Mr. Lockwood^ I argued and complained, and flatly
refused him fifty times ; but in the long run he forced tne to
an agreement. I engaged to carry a letter from him to my
mistress ; and should she consent, I promised to let him
have inteUigence of Linton's next absence from home, when
he might come, and get in as he was able : I wouldn't be
there, and my fellow-servants should be equally out of the way-
" Was it right or wrong? I fear it was wrong, though ex-
pedient. I thought I prevented another explosion by my
compliance ; and I thought, too, it might create a favourable
crisis in Catherine's mental illness : and then I remembered
Mr. Edgar's stem rebuke of my carrying tales ; and I tried to
smooth away all dittquietude on the subject, by affirming, with
frequent iteration, that that betrayal of trust, if it merited so
harsh an appellation, should be the last. Notwithstanding,
my journey homeward was sadder than my journey thither ;
and many misgivings I had, ei^e I could prevail on myself tQ
put the missive into Mi's, Linton's hand.

Mrs. Lmton safe in a loo€e white dress, with a lighb
Bhawl over her shoulders, in tho recess of the open window,
9B usual. Het thick, long hair had l^een partly removed at
the beginning of her illness, and now she wore it simply
combed in its natural tresses over hor temples and neck.
Her appearance was altered, aa I had told Hcathcliff; but
when she was calm, there Boemed unearthly beauty in tha
change. The flash of her eyes had been Buoceedod by a
dreamy and melancholy softnosa ; they no longer ^a,ve the
impression of looking at the objects around her: they
appeared always to gaze beyond, and for beyond— you would
have saJd out of this world. Then, the paleness of her face
— its haggard aspect having vanished as she recovered fiesh
— -ftnd the peculiar expression arising from her mental state,
though painfully eiuggeafcive of their causes, added to the
touching interest which she awakened; and — invaiiably to
me, I know, and to any person who saw her, I shoiLld tliitik
^L— refuted more tangible proofs of convalescenoo, and stamped
^■her aa one doomed to decay.
^M A book lay spread on the sill before her, and the scarcely
^kerceptible wind Buttered Its leaves at intervals. I believe
^■dnlon had laid it there : for she never endeavoured bo
^divert herself vrith readings or occupation of any kind, and he
would spend many an hour in trying to entice hor afct.ention
to some subject which had formerly been her amusement.
She was conscious of his aim, and in her better moods
endured hh efforts placidly, only showing their uselessne^s
by now and then suppressing a wearied sigh, and checking
bun at last with the saddest of smiles and kisses. At other
times^ she would turn petulantly away, and hide hei'face in
her hands, or even push him off angrily ^ and then bo took
^e to let her alone, for he was certain of doing no good.
Gimitierton chapel bells were still ringing ; and the full,

on the ear. It was a sweet substitute for the yet absent

permit it ; turning abruptly, he walked to the fireplace,
where he stood, silent^ with his • back towards us. Mrs.

woke a nGw sentiment in her. After apause and a prolonged

In her eagerness she rose and supported herself on tho
of the chair. At that earnest appeal he turned to hor,
»king ah^^lutely desperate. His eyes, wide and wet, at
it flashed fiercely on her ; his breast heaved convulsively,

owu species : it appeared fahat he would not onderBtflJid,
though I Bpoko to him ; so I stood off, and held my tongue,
m great perplexity.
A movement oi Catherine's relieved me a little preeently:
she put up her hand to clasp his neck, and bring her cheek
to his as he held her ; while he, in return, covenng her with
frantic caresses, said wildly —
* You teach me now how cruel you've been — cruel and
false. Wkif did you despise me ? Wliy did you betray your
own heart, Cathy ? I have not one word of comfort, Yoa
deserve this. You have killed yourself. Yes, you may kiss
me, and cry ; and wring out my kisses and tears : they'll
blight you — they'll damn you. You loved me — then wh & l
ri^hi had you to leave me? What right — answer ma— ^for
the poor fancy you felt for Linton ? Because misery and
degradation, and death, and nothing that God or Satan oouM
jiflicti would have parted us, you, of your own will, did it.
I i^ave not broken your heart — you have broken it; and in
breaking it, you have broken mine. So much the worse for
me that I am strong. Do I want to live ? What kind of
living will it be when you — oK God I would you like to hn
with your soul iu the grave ?'
* Let me alone. Let me alone/ sobbed Catherine- *If
I've done wrong, I'm dying for it. It is enough I You left
me too : hut I won't upbraid you t I forgive you. Forgive

They were silent — their faces hid against each otheri and
^-washed by each other's tears* At least, I suppose the weep-

you saw at Wuthering Heights r a puny, aeven-moDtha*
child ; and two hours after the mother died, having never
recovered sufficient oonaciousneaa to miss HeathclifiF, or know
Edgar* The I & tter's distraction at his bereaveKiBnt is a
subject too painful to be dwelt on ; its after-effects showed how
doep the sorrow sunk. A great addition, in my eyes, was
his being loft without an heii'. I bemoaned that^ as I gazed
on the feeble orphan ; and I mentally abused old Linton for
(what was only natural partiality) the securing his estate to
hifl own daughter, instead of his son's. An unwelcomed
infant it was, poor thing ! It might have wailed out of hfe,
and nobody cared a morsel, during those first hotirs of
existpencc. We redeemed the neglect afterwards ; but its
I beginning was as friendless as its end is hkely to be.
Next morning— brtghfr and cheerful out of doors — stole
I softened in through the blinds of the silent room, and
I Buffuscd the couch and its occupant with a mellow, tender
^^^w. Edgar Linton had his head laid on the pillow, and his
^^kes shut. His young and fair features were almost as
^Heathlike as those of the form boside him, and almost as
P^Uetl : but his was the hush of exhausted anguish, and hers
\ of perfect peace. Her brow smooth, her lids closed, her lips
I wearing the expression of a smile ; no angel in heaven could
I be more b < .iautiful than she appeared. And I partook of the
j infinite ealto in which she lay: tay mind was never in a
I holier fratue than while I gazed on that untroubled image of
Divine rest. I instinctivt^ly echoed the words she had
uttered a few hours before :'Incomparably beyond Eiad

might have doubted^ after the wayward and impatient
exifitenoe she had led, whether she merited a haven of peace
at last. One might doubt in seasons of cold reflection ; but
not then, in the preaence of her corpse* It asserted ita own
tranquillity, which seemed a pledge of equal quiet to its
former inhabitant.
Do you believe such people are happy in the other woddi^
air ? I'd give a great deal to know.
I declined answering Mrs. Dean's question, which Btni <
me aa something h^tgrodox. She proceeded :
Retracing the courae of Catherine Linton, I fear we hava'
no right to think sbo is ; but we'll leave her with her Maker.
The master looked asleep* and I ventured soon after sun- <
rise to quit the room and stual out to the pure refreshing air.
The servants thought me gone to shake off the drowainees of'
my protracted watch ; in reality, my chief motive was
seeing Mr. Heathclifl'. If he had remained among the
larches all night, he would have heard nothing of the stir at
the Grange; unless, perhaps, he might cat-ch the gallop of
the messenger going to Gimmerton. If he had come nearer,
he would probably be aware, from the lights flitting to and
fro, and the opening and shutting of the outer doors, that all
was not right within, I wnahed, yet feai'ed, to find him. I
felt the terrible news must be told, and I longed to get it

three feet from him, busy in building their ne & t, and regarding
his proximity no more than that of a piece of timber. They
flew off at my approach, and he raised his eyes and spoke :—

that. Put your handkerchief away^don't snivel before me.

I was weeping aa much for him as her : we do sometime^
pity creatures that have none of the feeling either for them*i
Belvea or others. When I first looked into his face, I
perceived that he had got intelligence of the catastrophe ; and
a foolish notion Btnick m© that bis heart was quelled and he
prayed, because his lips moved and his ga^e was bent on the
ound.
'Yea, she's dead 1 * I auBwered, checking my sobs and
drying my cheeks, * Gone to heaven, I hope ; where we may,
every one, joio her, if we take due warning and leave our

'Did she take due warnings then?* asked HeathcUff,

He endeavoured to pronounce the name* but could not
manage it; and compressing his mouth he held a silent
combat with his inward agony, defying^ meanwhile, my
sympathy with an unflinching, ferocious stare,'How did
she die ?'he resumed^ ab last — f aiUp notwithstanding his

ra. Lintoti'a funeral was appointed to taka place on the
Friday foUowiDg her decease : and till then her coffin
remained uncovered, and strewn with flowers and scented
leaves, tn the great drawing-room. Linton spent his days
and nights there, a sleepleBs guardian ; and— a circumstance
nccalod from all but me— Heathcliff spent hia nights^ at
t, outside, equally a stranger to repose. I bald no
mmunication with him: still, I was conscious of his desi^
to enter, if he could ; and on the Tuesday, a little after dark,
when my master, from sheer fatigue, had been compoUed to
retire a couple of hours, I went and opened one of the
windows ; moved by his perseverance to give him a chance
of bestowing on the forded imagu of his idol one final adieu.
He did not omit to avail hiiriBelf of the opportunity, cautiously
and briefly ; too cautiously to betray hia presenoo by the
slightest noise. Indeed, I shouldn't have disoovered that ho
had been there, except for the disarrangement of the drapei'y
about the corpse's face, and for observing on the floor a ourl
of light hair, fastened with a silver thread ; which, on exami*
tlon, I aacertained to have been taken from a locket hung
und Catherine's neck, Heathcliff had opened the trinket
and cast out its contents, replacing them by a black lock of
his own, I twisted the two, and enclosed them together,
Mr. Earnshaw was, of coui'se, invited to attend the remains

wholly composed of tenants and servants. Isabella was not
asked.
The place of Catherine's interment, to the surprise of the
lillagfira, was neither in the chapel under the carved monu*
ment of the Lintons^ nor yet by the tombs of her own rela-
tions, outside. It was dug on a green slope in a corner of
the kirk-yard, where the wall is so low that heath and
bilberry-plants have olimU^d over it from the moor; and
pni-mould almost buries it. Her husband lias in the same

The intruder was Mrs. Heathcliff, She certainly accmed
in DO laughing predic^jsaent : her hair streamed on her Bhoul-
ders, dripping with snow and water ; she waa dressed in the
girlish dress she commonly wore, befitting her age more than
her position : a low frock with short aleevea, and nothing on
either head or neck. The frock was of light silk, and clun^
to her with wet, and her feet were protouted merely by thin
slippers ; add to this a deep cut under one ear^ which only
(be oold prevented from bleeding profuselyj a white faoe
gcratched and bruised, and a frame hardly able to support
itfielf through fatigue ; and you may fa,ncy my first fright was
not much allayed when I had hiwl leisure to examine her.
'My dear young lady/ I exclaimed,'FU stir nowhere, and

and never mind how Mr, Eamahaw may occupy himself ;

'Yester-evening I sat in my nook reading some old hooka
late on towards twelve. It seamed so dismal to go up-
stairs, with the wild enow blowing outaidef and my thoughts
continually reverting to the kirk-yard and the new-made
grave ! I dared hardly lift my eyes from the page before me,
that melancholy scene so instantly usurped its place.
Hlndley sat opposite, his he^d leant on his hand : perhapg
meditating on the same subject. He had ctjased drinkiug
at a point below irrationality, and had nt^itber stirred nor
Bpoken during two or three hours. There was no sound
ugh the house but the moaning wind, which shook the
indows every now and then, the faint crackling of the
Is, and the click of my snu^fei's as I remo%'^ed at intervals
the long wick of the candle. Hareton and Joseph were pro-
bably fast asleep in bed. It was very, very sad : and whila
I read I sighed, for it seemed as if all joy had vanished from
the world, never to be restored.
- The doleful silence was broken at length by the sound
of the kitchen latch : HeathcliJQf had returned from hie
watoh earlier than usual ; owing, I suppose^ to the sudden
etorm. That entrance was fastened, and we heard him
coming round to get in by the other. I rose with an
irrepressible expression of what I felt on my Lips, which in-
duoed my companion, who had been staring tcw^ds thd
door, to turn and look at me.

lie better world ; whore he doubted not she was gone.
And he had earthly consolation and 3.£roct.ion3 also.
''or a few day?, I said, he seemed rega-rdless of the puny
uocefisor to the departed ; that coldness melted aB fast as
now in April, and ere the tiny thiug < iould gtammer a word
iT totter a step it wielded a despot'^ sceptre in his heart.
i was named Catherine ; Imt he never called it the name in
all, as he hod never called the first Catherine short : pro-
lably bec£iuse Heathdiff had a habit of doing so. The little
me was always Cathy : it formed to him a distinction from
he toother, and yet a connection with her; and hia attach-
neiit sprang from its relation to her, far more thEun from its
)eing his own.
I used to draw a comparison between him and Hindley
EkunsbaWp and perplex myself to explain satisfactorily why
iieir conduct was eo opposite in similar circumatances.
rhey had both been fond husbandsj n,nd were both attachtjd
to their children ; and I could not see how they shouldn't
both have taken the same road, for good or evil. Butj I
thought in my mind, Hindley, with apparently the stronger
head, has sho^vn himself sadly the worse and the weaker
man. When his ship struck, the captain abandoned his
post ; and the crew, instead of trying to save hur, nished
into riot and confusion, leaving no hope for their luckless
Teasel. Linton, on the contrary, displayed the true courage
o! a loyal and faitliful aoul : ho trusted God ; and God com-
forted him. One hoped, and the other despaired : Lhey chose
their own lots, and were righteously doomed to endure them.
But you'll not want to hear my moralising, Mr. Ijockwood ;
you'll judge, as well as I can^ all these things : at least,
jou'll thJtik you will, and that's tne same. The end of

claim on my services aa strong as hh own. Besides, X re-
minded him that the child Haj-eton was his wife's nephew,
and, in the ahsence of nearer kin, he ought to act as its
guardian ; and he ought to and roust inquire how the
property was left, and look over the concerns of his brother-
in-law. He was unfit for attending to such matters then,
but he bid me speak to his lawyer ; and at length permitted
me to go. His lawyer had been Eiimshaw's also : I
called at the village, and asked him to accompany me. He
shook his head, and advised that Heathcliff should be let
alone ; affirming^ if the truth wei'e known, Hareton would be
found little else than a beggiu\

in that interval he fastened the two doors of the house against

deliberately i We broke in this moruiug, for we heard him
snorting like a horse ; and there he was, laid over the settle :
flaying and scalpiag would not have wakenad htm. I sent

I infiieted on the funeral being respectable, Mr. Emlk-

deaired me to remember that the money for the whole iShk
came out of his pocket. He maintained a h & rd, o & rdaB
deportment, indicative of neither joy noraoiTow : if anythiii^
it exprsBsed a flinty grati^cation at a piece of diffictdi wocfc
Buccessfully executed. I observed once^ indeed, something
like exultation in hia aspect : it waa just when the pS0^
were bearing the coffin from the house. He had the h3rp >
orisy to represent a mourner : and previous to following wih
Haieton^ he lifted the unfortunate child on to the tabid ul
muttered, with peculiar guato,'Now, my bonny lad, youiw
mirts / And we'll see if one tree won*t grow aa crooked m
another, with the same wind to twigt it !'The uueuspectiag
thing was pleased at thia speech : he played with He^thdilfi
whiskers, and stroked hia cheek; but I dinned its meaniuf^
and observed tartly^'That boy must go back with mewj

'Does Linton say so ?'he demanded,
* Of course — he has ordered me to take him,'I replied.

This hint was enough to bind our hands. I repeated i1*

at the commencement, spoke no more of interfering, I'ln
not aware that he could have done it to any purpose, had he
been ever so willing.
The guest waa now the maater of Wuthering Heights : he
held firm poasession, and proved to the attorney — who, in his
turn, proved it to Mr. Linton — that Eamshaw had mortgaged

195
every yard of land he owned for cash to supply his mania
for gaming ; and he, Heathcliff, was the mortgagee. In that
manner Hareton, who should now be the first gentleman in
the neighbourhood, was reduced to a state of complete de-
pendence on his father's inveterate enemy ; and lives in his
own house as a servant, deprived of the advantage of wages :
qmte unable to right himself, because of his friendlessness,
ftud his ignorance that he has been wronged.
CHAPTER XVin
Thb twelve yearSf oontinued Mrs. Dean^ following that dismal
period were the happiest of my life: my greatest troubles in
their passage rose from our little lady's triQing illnessesi vrbicb
eha had to experience in oommon with all children, rich and
poor. For the rest, after the first six months, she grew like
a larclij and could walk and talk too, in her own way, belore
the heath blossomed a second time over Mi's. Linton's dusl.
She was the most winning thing that ever brought sunBhins
into a doBolOite house : a real beauty in face, with the EaiP*
shaws'handsome dark eyes, hut the Lintons'fair skin aDd
small features, and yellow curling hair. Her spirit was higb,
though not rough, and qualified by a heart sensitive und
lively to excesa in its affections. That capacity for inteuM
attachments reminded me of her mother: Btill she did no^
resemble her : for she could be soft and mild as a dove, and
she had a gentle voice and pensive expression : her anger
was never furious ; her love never fierce : it was deep aud
tender. However, it must be acknowledged, she had fanltt
to foil her gifts. A propensity to be saucy was one ; and A
perverse will, that indulged children invariably aoqiiii»i
whether they be good tempered or cross* If ft Ben?aB*
chanced to vex her, it was always —'I shall tell papa I'h^
if he reproved her, even by a look, you would have ihougli*

speak a harsh word to her. He took her sdnca^tion entirtly
on himself, and made it an amusoment. Fortunatelyi
curiosity and a quick intellect made her an apt scholar : flt^

Till she reached the age of thirteen she had nob once been
beyond the range of the park by herself. Mr. Linbon would
talce her with him a mile or so outaide, on rare occasions : but
he trusted her to no one elae. Gimmerton was an unsubstan-
tial name in her ears ; the chapel, the only building Bhe had
approached or entered, except her own home. Wulhering
Heights and Mr, Heathcliff did not exist for her : she was
ft perfect recluse ; and, appjtrenlly^ perfectly contented.
Sometimes, indeed, while surveying the country from her
nursei-y window, she would obaeiTe —
'Ellen, how long will it be before I can walk to the top
of those hills ? I wonder what lies on the other side — is it
^e sea ? *
'No» Miss Cathy/ I would answer ;'it is hills again, just
like these/
'And what are those golden rcwks like when you stajid
under them ?'she once asked.
The abrupt descent of Penistone Crags particularly
atti'acted her notice ; especially when the setting sun shone
OB it and the topmost heights, and the whole extent of land-
scape besides lay in shadow. I expUined that tliey were bare
masses of stone, with hardly enough earth in their clefts to
nourish a stunted tree*
'And why are they bright so long after it is evening here ?'
fihe pursued.
'Because they are a great deal higher up than we are,'
replied I ;'you could not dtnab them, they are too high and
steep. In winter the frost is always there before it comes to
ns ; and deep into summer I have found snow under that
black hollow on the north-east side I'
'Oh, you have been on them ! * she cried gleefully.
'Then I can go, too, when I am a woman. Has papa been,
Ellen?'
'Papa would tell you. Miss,'I answered, hastily,'that
they are not worth the ti^ouhle of visiting. The moors, where
you ramble vrith him, are much nicer ; and Thrusbcrosa Park
ia the finest place in the world/

'But I know the parlt, and I don*i know Iboee,* she
murmured to herself,'And I should dclifibfc to look ro^n^
nio from the brow of that tallcat point : my Utile pony Miimy
shall take me some time/
Ono of the maida mentioning the Fairy Cave, quite turned
her h43ad with a desire to fulial this projeut : she te & sed Mr.
Liaton ahout it ; and he promised ehe should h & ve the jour^
nay when she got older, But Miss Catherine moasured her
ago by months, and,'Now, am I old enough to go to Pen:*
Btono CragH?'was the constant question in her mouth. The
road thither wound close by Wutheritig Heights, Edgar liad
not the heart to pass it ; bo sha received as constantly tha
answer, * Not yet, love : not yet.'
I said Mrs. Ueathcliff lived above a dojsen yeara after
quitting her husband. Her family were of a delioato ooa-
Btltution : she and Edgar both lacked the ruddy health lU^
you will generally meet in these parts. What her last ill*
ness was, I am not certain : I conjecture, they died of the
same thing, a kind of fever, slow at its commoncement, buS
incurable, and rapidly consuming life towards the doso.
She wrote to inform her brother of the probable oonclafli(Ki
of a four-months* indisposition under which she ^^
suffered, and entreated him to come to her^ if possible ; (or
she had much to settle;, and slic wished to bid him adiea,
and deliver Linton safely into his hands. Her hope was
that Linton might be left wich hira^ as ho had been wilii her:
hia father, she would fain convince heraelf, had no desire W
assume the burden of his maintenance or education. My
master hesitated not a moment in complying with her re-
quest : reluctant as he was to leave home at ordinary oA
he flew to answer this ; commending Catherine to sij
peculiar vigilance, in his absence, with reiterated orders thri
she must not wander out of the park, even under my escort *
he did not calculate on her going unnocompanied.
He was away three weeks. The first day or two Wf
charge sat in a corner of the library, too sad for either read'
ing or playing: In that quiet state she caused mo liUie

afcful wenrineBg ; and being too busy^ aud too old theo, to
LD up and dowu anmsing her, I hit on a method by which
te might entertain heraeir I used to send her on her
avels round the grounds— now on foot, and now on a pony ;
dulging her with a patient audience of all her real and
Qftginary adventures when she returned.
The summer shoue in full prime ; and she took such a
«te for this solitary rambling that she often contrived to
im & in out from breakfast till tea ; and then the evenings
ere spent in recounting her fanciful tales. I did not fear
er brealdng bounds ; because the gates were generally
icked, and I thought: she would scarcely venture forth
lone, if they had stood wide open. Unluckily, my confi-
enoe proved misphwed. Catherine came to me, one
aoming, at eight o'clock, and Baid nhe was that day an
^bian merchant, going to cross the Desert with hia cara-
van ^ and I must give her plenty of provision for hei'self and
)east9 : a horse, and three caraelsj personated by a large
30und and a couple of pointers. I got together good store
)f dainties, and slung them in a basket on one side of the
a^dle ; and she sprang up as gay as a fairy* sheltered by
her wide-brimmed hat and gauze veil from the July sun, and
trotted off with a meny ln.ugh, mocking my cautious counsel
toavoid galloping, and come back early. The naughty thing
*»fer made her appearance at tea. Oae traveller, the houndp
l > elng an old dog B.nd fond of its eaae, returned ; but neither
Calhy, nor the pony, nor the two pointers were visible in
Wiy direction : I deKpatched emiHsaries down this path, and

Hareton.
* Nay,'he replied, looking down, and blushing baslilnlly.
He could not stand a etoady gaze from her oycs, though
they wei-e just his own.
'Whose then — your master's ?'sho asked.

■whose rankness far over-topped their neglected growth ; jbI,
notwithstanding, evidence of a wealthy soil, ihat oight

physically ill ; thanks to his fearless naturei which offered no
temptation to that ooursa of oppression : he had none of the
timid susceptibility that would have given seat to ill-traat-
meat, in HeathcUfTs judgment. He appeared to have bent
bis malevolence on making him a brute : he was never
taught to read or write ; never rebuked for any bad b & bit
which did not annoy bis keeper; never led a single step
towards virtue, or guarded by a single precept against vice.
And from what I heard^ Joseph contributed much to his
deterioration, by a narrow-minded partiality which prompted
him to datter and pet him, as a boy, because he waft tha
head of the old family. And as he had been in the habit of
accusing Catherine Eamshaw and Heathcliff, when children*

to seek solace in drink by what he termed their * oCTald vt & j^'

behaved. It gave Joseph satisfactiion, apparently, to watch
him go the worst lengths: he allowed that the lad was
ruinecl : that his soul was abaDdonetl to perdition ; but then
he reflected that Heathcliff must answer for It, Hareton's
blood would be required at hia hands ; and there lay itnmenae
consolation in that thought. Joseph had instilled into him a
pride of na.me} and of his lineage ; he would, had he dared,
have fostered hate between him and the present owner of
the Heights : but his dread of that owner amounted bo
Baperstition ; and he confined his feelings regarding him to
muttered innuGndoeB and private comminations. I don't
pretend to be intimately acquainted with the mode of living
customary in those days at Wuthering Heights : I only
speak from hearsay ; for I saw little. The villagers affirmed
Mr* Heathchff was fieavt and a cruel hard landlord to hi3
tenants ; but the house, inside, had regained its ancient
aspect of comfort under Female management, and the scenes
©f riot common in Hindley's time were not now enacted
-within its walls. The master was too gloomy to seek
companionship with any people, good or bad ; and he is yet.
This, however, is not making progress with my story.
Miss Cathy rejected tlie peace-offering of the terrier, and
demanded her own dogs, Charhe and Phoenix. They came
limping and hanging their heads ; and we set out for home,
sadly out of sorts, every one of us, I could not wring from
tny Uttle lady how she had spent the day ; except thatj as I
supposed, the goal of her pilgrimage was FeniBtone Crags ;
and she arrived without adventure to the gate of the farm-
house* when Hareton happened to issue forth^ attended by
BOme canine followers, who attacked her train* They had a
■Qiart battle, before their owners could separate them : that
fonned an introduction. Catherine told Hareton who she
*ft8, and where she was going ; and asked him to show her
the way ; finally, beguiling him to accoinpany her. He
opened the mysteries of the Faky Cave, and twenty other
qaeer places. But, being in disgrace, I was not favoured

I refused staunchly. At length her suspense was ended :
the travelling carriage rolled in sight. Miss Cathy shrieked
and stretched out her arms as soon as she caught her
father's face looking from the window. He desceadeil,
nearly as eager as herself ; and a considerable iutetral
elapsed ere fchey had a thought to spare for any but themiielves.
While they exchanged careaees I took a peep in to see after
Linton. He was asleep in a corner, wrapped in a wanDi fur-
lined cloak, as if it had been winter. A pale, delicate,
effenainatc boy, who might have been taken for my magtei's
younger brother, so strong was the resemblance : but tbei^
waa a sickly peevishness in bis aspect that Edgar Ltaton
never had. The latter saw me looking ; and haTing shaken
hiuida, advised me to close the door, ajid leave hun undis-
turbed ; for the journey had fatigued him. Cathy " would to
have taken one glance, hut her father told her to come^ and
they walked together up the pork, while I hastened before
to prepare the servanta.
* Now, darling,* said Mr, Linton, addressing his daughter,
& s they halted at the bottom of the front steps :'your cousin
is not so strong or so merry as you are, and he haa lost his

The can'iage stopped ; and the sleoper being roused, was
lifted to the ground by his uncle.
*This is your cousin Cathy, Linton,'he said, putting their
little hands together.'She's fond of you already ; and mind

do but rest and amuse yourself as you pleaBo,*
'Let me go to bod, then/ answered, the boy, shrinking
from Cathorine'^ Balute ; and he put his fingers to remove
incipient tears.
'Gome, come, there's a good child/ I wbisperod^ leading
him in.'You'll make her weep too — see how sorry ahe is for

I do noti know whether it was sorrow for him, hut, his
cousin put on as aad a countenance as himself, and roturned
to her father. All three entered, and mounted to the library,
where tea was laid ready, I proceeded to remove Linton's
cap and mantle, and placed him on a chair by the table ; but
he was no sooner seated than he began to cry afresh. My
master inquired what was the matter.
• I can't sit on a chair/ sobbed the boy.
'Go to the sofa, then, and Ellen shall bnng you some
teft/ answered his uncle patiently.
He had been greatly tried, during the journey, I felt con-
vinced, by his fretful aihng charge. Linton slowly trailed
himself off, and lay down. Cathy carried a footstool and her
cup to his side- At first she sat silent ; but that could not
last : sbs had resolved to make a pet of her Little cousin, as
she would have him to be ; and she commenced stroking hia
cmrla, and Missing his cheek, and offering him tea in her
saucer, like a baby. This pleased biui, for he was not
much better : he dried hia eyes, and lightened Into a faint
snailo.

But he had sense to postpone complaining : there might be

diatoiicsa, to teach him what he pleasee to learn. I've
ordered Hareton to obey him : and in fact IVe arranged
everything with a view to preserve the superior and the
gentleman in him, above his associates. I do regret,
however, that he so little deserves the trouble : if I wished
any blessing in the world, it was to find .him a worthy

While he was spcn^king, Joseph returned bearing a basin
of milk-porridge^ and placed it before Linton : who stirred
rottnd the homely mesa with a look of aversion, and affirmed
he could not eat it, I saw the old man-servant shared
largely in his master's scorn of the child ; though he was
compelled to retain the sentiment in his heart, because
Heatfadiff plainly meant his underlings to hold him in
honour.
* Cannot ate it?'repeated he, peering in Linton's faoo,
and subdumg his voice to ^ whisper, for fear of being over*
beard.'But Maiater Hareton nivir ate naught else, when

quainting him with the turn Heathcli^s humour has taken.
Having no excuse for lingering longer, I slipped out, while
Linton was engaged in timidly rebuking the adv & n^eB of a
friendly aheep-dog. But he waa too much on the alert to
be cheated ; as I closed the door, I heard a cry, and a frifltk!

CHAPTER XXI
Wb had sad work with little Cathy that day ; eho rose in
high glee, eager to join her cousin, and snob pasBionate t & ars
and lamentations followed the news of his departure that
Edgar himself was obliged to soothe her, by alRrming ho
should come hack soon: he added, however,'if I can get
bim * ; and there were no hopes of that. Thia promise
pCMsrly pacified her ; but time was more potent ; and though
still at intervals she inquired of her father when Liaton
would return, before she did & & & him again his features
had waxed eo dim in her memory that she did i3ot rocogruHe
When I chanced to encounter the housekeeper of
uthering Heights^ in paying businesB visits to GimmBrton,
I used to ask how the young master gnt on ; for he lived
almost as secluded as Catherine herself, and wa?^ never to be
seen. I could gather from her that ho continued in weak
health, and was a tiresome inmate* She said Mr. Heath-
ciifT seemed to dislike him ever longer and worRO^ though ho
took some trouble to conceal it: he had an antipathy to the
Bound of his voice, and could not do at all with his sitting
in the same room with him ranny minutes together. There
seldom passed much tiilk between them : Linton learnt his
lessons and spent his evenings in a small apiirtrnent they
called the parlour: or else lay in bed all ilay : for he was
constantly getting coughs, and colds, and aches, and pains of
some sort.
* And I never knew such a faint-hearted creature/ added
the woman ;'nor one bo careful of hisseln. He will go on,

220

if I leave the window open & bit late in the eveniisg. Oh I
it's killing, a breath of night air ! And he miist have a fire
in tha middle of summer ; and Joseph's bacca-pipe is poison;
and he must always have sweets md dainties, and always
milk, milk for ever— heeding naught how the rest o! ta »re
pinched in winter; and there he'll ait, wrapped in his furred
cloak in his chair by the fire, with some toast and water or
other slop on the hob to sip at ; and if Hareton, for pity,
comes to amuse him — Hareton ia not bad-natured, tbough
he's rough — they're sure to part* one sweanng and the other
crying. I believe the master would relish Eamahaw's
thrashing him to a mummy, if he were not bis son ; and I'
certain he would be fit to turn him out of doors, if he koe
half the nursing he gives hisseln. But then he won't go
danger of temptation : he never enters the parlour,
should Linton show those ways in the house where be is,
sends him up-stairs directly.'
I divined, from this account, that utter lack of syrDpaA;
had rendered young HeathcIifT & elfigb and disagreeable, if
were not so onginally; and my interest in him, eon
quenlly, decayed : though still I was moved with a sense
grief at his lot, and a wish that he had been left with
Mr. Edgar encouraged me to gaiu information: he thoug
a great deal about him, I fancy, and would have run
risk to see him ; and he told me once to ask the houselcGepe
whether he ever came into the village ? She said he h;
only been twice, on horseback, accompan^'ing bis father
and both times he pretended to be quite kr^ockod
for three or four days afterwards. That hou
left, if I recollect rightly, two years after he catne; and
other, whom I did not know, was her successor ; she 11
there still.
Time wore on at the Grange in its former pleasant wa]
till Miss Cathy reached sixteen. On the anniversary of hfif
birth we never manifested any signs of rejoicing* b6 < :au8e i
was also the anniversary of my late mistress's death. Ha:

walked, at dusk, as far as Gimmerton kirkyard, where ha
would frequently prolong his stay beyond midnight. Theie-
re Catherine was thrown on her own resourcoa for amuse-
ent. This twentieth of March was a beautiful spring day,
and when her father had retired, my young lady came down
di^ssed for going out, and said she asked to have a ramble
on the edge of the moor with me : Mr. Linton had given her
leave, if we went only a short distance and were back within
the hour.
'So make haste, Ellen !'she cried.'I know where I
wish to go; where a colony of moor-game are settled; I
want to iee whether they have made their nests yet/
'That must be a good distance up,'I answered ;'they
don't breed on the edge of the moor.*
'No, it's not,'she said.'IVe gone very near with
papa.'
I put on my bonnet and sallied out, thinking nothing more
of Uie matter* She bounded before me, and returned to my
eide, and was ofif again like a young greyhound ; and, at & rBt,
I found plenty of entertairnnent in listening to the larka
singing far and near, and enjoying the sweet, warm sun-
fihine ; and watching her, my pet and my delight, with her
golden ringlets flying loose behind, and her bright cheek, as
Boft and pure in its bloom as a wild rose, and her eyes
radiant with cloudless pleasure. She was a happy creature,
and an angel^ in those days. It's a pity she could not be
ntent.
* Well/ said I,'where are your moor-game, Miaa Cathy?
We should be at tJbem : the Grange park-fence is a great way
DOW.'
* Oh, a little further— ^nly a little further, Ellen,'was her
knawer, continually^ * Climb to that hillock, pass that bank,
and by the time you reach the other side I shall have raised
the blrdB/
But there were so many hillocke and banks to climb and
pass, that, at length, I began to be weary, and told her we
oiufit halt, and retrace our steps. I shouted to her, ae she

did not regai'd, for she still sprang on, and I waa coiiipeLlt > d bo
follow. Finally, she dived into a hollow ; and before I cama
ia sight of her again, she vfos two miles nearer Wuthering
Heights than her own home ; and I beheld a couple of persona
arrost her, one of whom I felt convLnoed was Mr, Heathdiff
himself.
Cathy had been caught in the fact of plundering, or,
at leEist, hunting out the nests of the grouse. The
Heights were HeathcUGTa land, and he was reproving the
poacher,
" I've neither taken any nor found any/ she said, as
I toiled to tlieni] expanding her hands in oorroborafcton of
the Btatpement.'I didn'tr mean to bake them ; but papa (old
me there were quantities up here, and I wished to see the
eggs.'
Heathdiff glanced at me with an ill-meaning smite,
expressing his acrjuaintance with the party, and, cons^
quently, his malevolence towards it, and demanded who
'papa'was ?
'Mr. Linton of Thrushcrosa Grange,* she replied.'I
thought you did not know me, or you wouldD*t have spoken
in tha^t way.'
'You suppose papa is highly esteemed and reapeoted,
then?'he said, sarcastically.
'And what are you?'inquired Catherine, gazing curi-
ously on the speaker.'That man I've seen before* Ib he
your Boa ? *
She pointed to Hareton^ the other individual, who had
gained nothing but increased bulk and strength by the adili-
tion of two years to hia age : he seemed as awkward & Dd
rough as ever.
'Misa Cathy/ I interrupted, *it will be three hours in-
stead of one that we are out, preBOntly. We really must go
back/
* No, that man is not my eon,* answered Heathchft push-
ing me ^de.'But I have one, and you h & ve soen him

before too ; and^ though your nurse ia in a hurry, I think
both yoo and she would be the better for a little rest.
" Will you just turn this nab of hoath, and walk into ray
house ? You'll get home earlier for the ease ; and you sh & U
receive a kind welcome/
I whispered Oafcherine that she mustti'ti on any
account, accede bo the proposal : it was entirely out of the
question.
'Why?'she asked^ aloud,'I'm tired of running, and
the ground is de^v^y : I can't ait here. Let us go, EUwn.
BeBides, he says I have seen his son. Hes mistaken,
I think ; but I guess where he lives : at the farmhouse I
visited in coming from Penistono Crags, Don't you ?'
*I do. Come, Nelly, hold your tongue— it will be a treat
for her to look in on us. Hai*eton, get forwards with the lass >
You shall walk with me, Nelly,'
* No, she's not going to any such place,'I cned^ struggling
to release my artn, which he had seized : but ehe was
almost at the door-stones already,- scampering round the
brow at full speed, Her appointed companion did not
pretend to escoi't her : he shied off by the road-aide, and
vanished.
* Mr. Heathcliff, it's very wrong,'I continued :'you know
you mean no good. And there shell see Linton, and all will
be told ELS soon aa ever we return ; and I shall have the
blame/
* I want her to see Linton,'he answered;'he's looking

* The harm of it ia» that her father would hate me if ho

vinced you have a had design in encouraging her to do so/ I
replied.

'If Linton died/ I answered,'and his life ia qiiile un-

'No, she would not/ he said.'There is no clause in the

prevent disputes, I desire their union, and B,m resolved to
bring it about.'
'And I'm resolved ahe shall never approach your house
with me again/ I returned, as we reached the gatpe, where
Miss Cathy waitred our coming.
Heathclifif bade me be quiet ; and, preceding us up th«
path, haBtened to open the door* My young lady gave him
several looks, as if she could not exactly make up her mind
what to think of hiai ; but now he smiled when he met her
eye, and softened his voice in addressing her; and I vraa
foolish enough to imagine the memory of her mother might
disarm him from desiring her injury, Linton stood on llw
hearth. He had been out walking in the fields, for his cap
was on, and he was calling to Joseph to bring him dry shoes.
He had grown tall of his age, still wanting some months o(
sixteen. His features were pretty yet, and his eye and com-
plexion brighter than I remembered them, though with
merely temporary lustre borrowed from the salubnous air
and gonial sun,
'Now, who 13 that?'asked Mr. Heathcliff, turning to
Cathy.'Can you tell ? *
* Your son ? * she said, having doubtfully surveyed, firei
one and then the other.

The youtb stepped forward, and acknowledged himself :
she kissed him fervently, and tphey gazed with wonder al
the change time had wrought in the appearance of each
Catherine had reached her full height; her figure was both
plump and slender, elastic as steel, and her whole aspect
sparkling with health and spirits. Linton's looks and move-
raenta were very languid, and his form extremely slight ;
but there was a grace in his manner that mitigated these
defects, and rendered him not unpleasing. After eschanging
numerous marks of fondness with him, his cousin went to
Mr. Heathcliff, who lingered by the door, dividing his atten-
tion between the objects inside and those that lay without :
pretendingt that is, to observe the latter^ and really noting
the former alone.
'And you are my uncle, then !'she cried, reaching up to
salute him.'I thought I hked you, though you were cross
at first. Why don't you visit at the Grange with Linton ?
To live all these years such close neighbours, and never see
us, is odd : what have you done so for ?'
* I visited it once or twice too often before you were born,*
he answered, * There — damn it t If you have any kisses to
spare, give them to Linton ; they are thrown away on me.'
'Naughty EUen 1 * exclaimed Cathenne, flying to attack
me next with her lavish caresses.'Wicked Ellen t to
try to hinder me from entering. But I'll take this walk
every morning in future: may J, uncle? and fiometimes
bring papa. Won't you be glad to see us ?'
'Of course,* replied the uncle, with a hardly suppressed
grimace, resuUing from his deep aversion to both the pro-
posed visitors. *But stay,* he continued, turning towards
the young lady.'Now I thmk of it, Fd better tell you.
Mr, Linton has a prejudice against me : w*e quarrelled at one
time of ouj^ lives, with unchristian ferocity ; and, if you
ntiou coming here to him, he*ll put a veto on your visits

afterwards cast a look of singular aversion on the Oippttni

finding animation enough while discussing Hareton's faults

and the girl relishing his pert and spiteful sayings, without
consideiii^g the ill-nature they evinced, I began to dislike,

We stayed till afternoon : I could not tear Miss Cathy away

* It was because you disliked Mr. Hcaihchff/ she

eho grew wondrous fond of atealing off to oomers by beraelf j
and often, if I camo near hor suddenly while reading, fiha
would start and bend over the book, evidently desirous to
hide it ; and I detected edges of loose paper sticking oui
beyond the leaves. She also got a trick of coming down
early in the morning iind lingenn** about tho kitchen, as H
iiho were expecting the anval of soiuething : and she had a
small drawer in a cabinet in the library, which she would
trifle over for hours, and whose key ahe took special oare to
remove when ehe kft it*
One day, as she inspected this drawer, I observed tluii
tho playthings and trinkets which recently formed its con-
tents were transmuted into bits of folded paper. My
curiosity and suspicions were roused ; I determined to Uke
a poop at her mysterious treasures ; bo, at night, a^ soon a &
aim and my master were safe upstairs, I searched, and reftdily
found among my house kej^s one that wouM fib tho lock.
Having opened, I emptied the whole contents into my apron,
and took them with me to examina at leisure in my own
chamber. Though I could not but Buspoct, I wt & s^
surprised to discover that they were a mass of correspondenoe
— daily almost, it must have been — from Linton HoalhcliS':
answers to documents forwardcid by her. The earlier dated
were embarrassed and short ; gradually, however, they
expanded into copious love-letters, foolish, as the age of tho
writer rendered natuTEj, yet with touches here and there
which I thought were borrowed from a more expenenced
ROurco. Souie of them struck me as singularly odd oDm-
pounds of ardour and flatness ; commencing in strong feeling*
and concluding in the affected, wordy style that a BchooUwy
might use to a fancied, incorporeaJ. sweetheart. Wbetbtr
Lliey satisfied Cathy I don't know ; hut they appeared very
worthless trash to me. After turning over as many as I
thought properj I tied them in a handkerchief and set them
a«ide, relocking the vacant drawer.
Following her habife^ my young lady descended early, and
viiuicd the kitchen: I watohod her go to the door^ on the

arriW of a ceriain liUle boy ; and. while the daiiymald filled
his can, she tucked soia^tliing iuto his jackolt pocket, and
plucked aomething out. I went round by tho garden, and
laid wait for the messenger ; who fought valorously to defend
his trust, and we spiU the milk between us ; but I succeeded
in abstracting the epistle ; and, threatening Berious con-
sequences if be did not look shaip home, I remained under
the wall and perused Miss Cathy's aCTectionato composition.
It was more siuaple and more eloquent thau her cousin's :
very pretty and very silly. I shook my head, and went
meditatiug into the house. The day being wet, she could
not divert herself with rambling about the park ; so, at the
ooDclusion of her morning studies, she resorted to the solace
of the drawer. Her father sat reading at the table ; and Ij
on purposej had sought a bit of work in some unripped fringes
of the window-curtain, keeping my eys streadily fixed on her
proceedings. Never did any bird flj'ing back to a plundered

stirred up the aehes, and interred them under a shovelful of
coals ; and she mutely, and with a sense of intense injury,
retired to her private apartment. I descended to tell my
master that the young lady's qualm of sickness was almost
gone, but I judged it heat for her to lie do^vn a while. She
wouldn't dme : but she reappeared at tea, pale, and red

inscribed, * Master Heathcliff is requested to send no more

Mich & elmaa, but the harvest was labe that year^ and a few of
our fielda were still uncleared. Mr* Liuton aud his daughter
would frequently walk out among the reapera ; at the carrying
of the laet sheaves they stayed ttli dusk, and bhe eveniag
happening to be chill and damp^ my master caught a bad
cold, that settled obstinately on hia lungs, and con & nad lum
indoors throughout the whole of the winter, nearly without
Id term L SB ion.
Poor Cathy^ fLughtened from her Little romance, had been
Gonsidei-ably sadder and duller since ita abandonment ; and
her father insisted on her reading less, and taking more
e^tercise. 8he had his companionship no longer; I esteemed
it a duty to supply ita lack, aa much as possible, with mine :
an inefficient substiLute ; for I could only spare two or three
hours, from my numerous diurnal occupations, to follow J
hei* footsteps, and then my society was obriously leesfl
desirable than his.
On an afternoon in October, or the beginning
November — a (i*esh watery afternoon, when the turf hxxi
paths were rustling with moist, withered leaves, and the cold'
blue sky was half liidden by clouda^daik grey stream
rapidly mounting from the west, and boding abundant
rain — I requested my young lady to forego her ramble,
because I was certain of showers. She refused ; and I
UDWilUugly donned a cloak^ and took my umbrella to
accompiiny her on a stroll to the bottom of the pork: a
formal walk which she generally affected if tow-spirited —

and th[bt aho invariably was when Mr, Edgar hoid been worse
than ordinfiry^ n thing never known from his confeesion, but

the melancholy of his countenance, Bhe went sadly on :
there waa no running or bounding now, though the chill
wind might well have tempted her to i-acc* And often, from
the side of my eye, I could detect her raising a hand, and
brushing something off her cheek. I gazed round for a
means of diverting her thoughts. On one side of the road
rofid a high, rough bank,'whore hazels and stunted oakB,
with their roots haH eKposad, held uncertain tenure : the soil
was too loose for the latter ; and strong winds had blown
some nearly horizontal. In summer Miss Catherine de*
lighted to climb along these trunks, and sit in the branches,
swinging twenty feet above the ground ; and I, pleased with
her agility and her light, childish heart, still eonsiderGd it
proper to ficold every timo I caught her at such an elevation,
but BO that she knew there was no necessity for descending.
From dinner to tea she would lie in her breeze-rocked cradle^
doing nothing except singing old songs — my nureeiy lore —
to herself, or watching the birda» joint tenants, feed and
Gntice their youug ones to fly : or nestling with closed lids,

up and seated herself on the top of the wall, reaching over to
gather some hips that bloomed scarlet on the summit

smooth and neatly oemantod, and the rose-bushes and black-
berry stragglers could yield no assistance in re-ascending*

and exclaiming^* Ellen I you'll have to fetch the key, or else

'Stay where you are,'I answered ;'I have my bundle of

Catherine amused herself with dancing to and fro before
the door, while I tried all the large keys in succession. I had
applied the last, and found that none would do ; so, repeating
my desire that ahe would remain there. I was about to hurry
home as fast as I could, when an approaching sound
lurrested me. It was the trot of a horse; Cathy's dance
stopped also.

Former question^ and pleased to detect the faiut dawn of a

wouldn't come. And papa swore it was owing to me : he
palled me a pitiful, shuSling, worthless thing ; and said you
despised me ; and if he had been in my place, be would be
more the master of Uie Grange than your fathei'by this

'I wish you would say Catherine, or Cathy/ interrupted
my young lady.'Despise you? Not Next to papa and
Ellen, I love you better than anybody living. I don't love
Mr. Heathcliff, though ; and 1 dai*e not come when b©

'Not many/ answered Linton ;'but he goes on to the
moors frequently, since the shooting season commenced ; and
you might spend an hour or two with me in his absence* Do
Bay you will. I think I should not be peevish with you :
you'd not provoke me, and you'd always be ready to help me,
wouldn't you ?'
'Yea/ said Catherine, stj-oking his long soft hair ;'if I
could only get papa'a consent, I'd spend half my time with
you* Pretty Linton I I wish you wero my brother.'

'No, I should never love anybody better than papa,* she

Linton denied that people ever hated their wives ; but
Cathy affirmed they did, and, in her wisdom, instanced his
own father's aversion to her aunt, I endeavoured to stop
her tboughdeaa tongue. I couldn't succeed till everything
she knew was out. Master Heathcliff, much irritated,
aas^rted her relation was false*
* Papa told me ; and papa does not tell falsehoods/ she
answered pertly.
'My papa scorns yours 1'crisd Linton* * He calls him a

Cathy, beside herself, gave the chair a violent puflh, & uti
caused him to fall againat one arm. He was immedtately
seized by a suCTocating cough that soon ended his triumph.
It lasted so long that it frightened even me. As to hi &

prevent another burst of emotion.
He sighed and moaned like one under great suffering, and
kept it up for a quarter of an hoar ; on purpose to distress
his cousin apparently, for whenever he caught a stifled sob
from her he put renewed pain and pathos into the infle^ons
of his voice,
'I'm sorry I hurt you, Linton/ she said at length, racked
beyond endurance, * But / couldn't have been hurt by that
litUe push, and I had no idea that you could, either : you > e
not much, are you, Linbon ? Don't let me go home thixiking

'I shall lift liim on to the settle/ I said,'and he may

She placed a cushioa under his head, aud ofiTei-ed him BOme

to put it more comfortably.

Gathenne repeated the longest she could remember. The
employment pleased both mightily. Linton would have
another, and a(t < cr that another,notwithstianding my strenuous
objections ; and so they went on until the clock Btmck twelve,
and we heard Hareton in tlie court, returning for his dinner.
'And to-morrow, Catherine, will you be here tQ« morrow ?'
aaked young Heathcli£f, holding her frock as she ro^

'No,'I answeired,'nor next day neither,* She, however,
gave a different response evidently, for his forehead cleared

when we were out of the house.'You are nob dreaming of

She smiled.

'I can get over the wall/ she said laughing,'The

Vra oertain Linton would recover quickly if he had me to
look after him. I'm older thstn he iSf you know, and wiser :
leas childish, am I not? And he'll eoon do as I direct him,
with some slight coaxing. He's a pretty little darting when
he's good. I'd make such a pet of him, if he were mine. We
should, never quarrel, should we after we were used to each
other? Don't you like him, Ellen?'
* Like bim I'I exclaimed.'The worst-temp & red bit of a
Bickly slip that ever struggled into its teens. Happily, as
Mr. Heathcliff conjecturBd, he'll not win twenty. I doubi
whether he'll see spring, indeed. And small loss to his
family whenever be drops off. And lucky it is for us th*l
his father look him : the kinder he was treated, the more
tedious and selfish he'd be. I'm glad you have no chanoeof
having him for a husband^ Miss Catherine.'
My companion waxed serious at hearing this Bfoecb.
To speak of his death so regardlessly wounded her feelings.
* He's younger than I,'she answered^ after a protracted
pause of meditation,'and he ought to live the longest : he
will — he must live as long as I do. He's as strong now as
when he first came into the north ; I'm positive of thstr
It*B only a cold that ails him, the same as papa has. Yoll

'Well, well/ I cried,'after all, we needn't trouble our-

without me, I shall inform Mr. Linton, and, unless he allow
it, the intimacy with your cousin must not he revived.'
* It has been revived,'muttered Cathy, aulMly.
'Must not be continued, then,'I said,
'We'll see,'was her reply, and she set off at a gallop,
leaving me to toil in the rear.
Wo both reached home before our dinner-time; my
master supposed we had been wandering through the park,
pbnd therefore he demanded no explanation of our absence.
As soon as I entered I hastened to change my soaked sheer

h & d. The moment Catherine left Mr. Linton's room ahe
K^peaied At my bedside. Her day was divided between us ;
QO amusement usurped a minute : she neglected her meals,
her studies, and her play ; and she was the fondest nurse
that ever watched. 8he must have had a warm heart, when
she loved her father so, to give so much to me* I said her
dftys were divided between us; but the master retired early,
fttid I ^nerally needed nothing after six o'clock, thus the
Bvemng wae her own. Poor thing! I never coneidcrod
what she did with herself after tea. At^d though frequently^
when she looked in to bid me good-ni^ht, 1 remarked a fresh
colour in her cheeks iind a pinkness over her slender fingera,
instead of fancying the hue borrowed from a cold ride
across the moore, X laid it to the charge of a hot £r6 tn the
library.
CHAPTER SXIV
At the close of three weeks I waa able to quit my chamber
and move about the bouse. And on the first occasioa ol my
Bitting up in the evening I asked Cathenue to read to i & e, ^

'ants aJSQrmed they had not seen her. I Estened at
Mr. Edgar's door ; all waa silence. I returned to her
apaxtment, extinguished my candle, and seated mysGlf in the
window*
The moon shone bright ; a sprinkling of anow covered
Uie ground, and I reflected that she might, possiblyj have
taken h into her head to walk about the garden, for refresh*
roent, I did detect a figure creeping along the inner fenoa
of the park ; but it was not my young mistress : on its
emerging into the lights I recognised one of the grooms. He
stood a considerable period, viewing the carriage-road
through the grounds ; then started off at a brisk pace, as if
he had detected something, and reappeared presently, lead-
iiig Mis &'a pony ; and there she v^^as, juat dismounted, and
walking by its side. The man book his chai'ge stealthtty
flcroBS the grass towards the stable. Cathy entered by the
caaenkent- window of the drawing-room, and glided noise-
lessly up to where I awaited her. She put the door gently
too, slipped off her snowy shoes, untied her hat, and was
proceeding, unconscious of my espionage, to lay aside her
taantle, when I suddenly rose and revoaled myself. The
surprise petrified her an instant : she uttered an inarUculate
ezclamaticn, and stood fixed,
* My dear Miss Catherine,'I began, too vividly impreBsed
by her recent kindness to break into a scold,'where have
you been riding out at this hour ? And why should you try
to deceive nae by telling a tale ? Where have you been ?
Speak t'

tell a tale.'
'And nowhere else?'I demanded.
* No,'was the muttered reply.
* Oh, Catherine I'I cried, sorrowfully.'You know
ycm have been doing wrong, or you wouldn't be diiven to
uttering an untruth to me, That does grieve me. Vd
rather be three months ill, than hear you frame a deliberate

She sprang forward, ikad bursting into tears, threw ber
anns round my neck.
'Well, Ellen, Vm so afraid of you being angry/ she said.
'Promiae not to be angry, and yoii shall know the very truth :
I hate to hide it/
We sat down in the window-aeat ; I assured her I would
not scoldp whatever her secret might be^ and I guessed It, of
course ; so she commenoed—
* JVe been to Wuthering HeightSj Ellen, and I've never
missed going a day aince you fell ill ; except thrioe before,
and twice after you left your rcx > m. I gave Minhaiel books
and pictures to prepare Minny every evening, and to put
her baok in the stable : you mustn't scold hirn either, mind,
I was at the Heights by half-past six^ and generally stayed
till half*ptipSt eight, and then galloped home. It was not to
ftmuBt) myself that I went: I was often wretched all the
UtBQ, Now and then I was happy : once in a week perh^i^
At first, I expooted there would be sad work perf^uading you
to let me keep my word to Linton : for I had engaged to call
ftgain next day, when we quitted him ; but, as you stayed np-
Btairs on the morrow, I escaped that trouble, WbUe
Miohoel was refasbening the lock of the park door in the
afternoon, I got posaesaion of the key, and told him how my
ooasin wished rae to visit him, because be waa sick, and
Gouldn^t come to the Grange ; and how papa would object to
my going : and then I negotiated with him about the pouy.
He is fond of reading, and he thinks of leaving soon to g»(
married ; so he offered, if I would lend him books out of llM ^
library, to do what I wished ; but I preferred giving him mjfl
own, and that satisfied him better.
* On my sacoad visit Linton seemed in lively spirita ;
and Zillah (that la their housekeeper] made us a clean room
and a good fire, and told ua that, as Joseph waa out at a
prayer-meeting and Har^ton Earnshaw was off with his
doga — robbing our woods of pheasants, as I heard after-

natured ; and Linton sat in the arm-chair, and I in the little
rocking chair on the hearth-stono^ and we laughed and talked
BO merrily^ and found so much to say : wo planned whero we
would go, and what we would do in summer. I needn't
repeat that, because you would call it aiUy,
'One time, however, we were near quBjrelling. He said
the pl & asanieat manner of spending a hot July day was lying
from morning till evening on a bank of heath in the middle
of the moora» wtth the bees humming dreamily about among
the bloom, and the larks singing high up overhead, and the
blue sky and bright sun shining steadily and cloudlessly.
That was hk moat perfect idea of heaven's happiness : mine
was rocking in a rustling green tree, with a west wind
blowing, and bright white clouds flitting rapidly above ; and
uoi only larks, but throstles, and blackbirds, and linnets, and
cuckoos pouring out music on every side, and the moora
seen at a diBtance, broken into cool dusky dells ; but close
by great swells of long grass undulating in waves to the
breeze; and woods and sounding water, and the whole
world awake and wild with joy. He wanted all to lie La an
ec & tasy of peace; I wanted all to sparkle and dance in a
glorious jubilee. I said his heaveri would be only half alive ;
and ha said mine would be dnink : I said 1 should fall
oaleep in his ; and ha said he could not breathe in mine, and
began to groiy very snappish. At last, we agreed to try
both] as soon as the right weather came ; and then we kissed
each other and were friends*
* After sitting still an houTj I looked at the great room
with its smooth uncarpeted floor, and tliouglit how nice it
would be to play in, if we removed the table ; and I asked
Linton to call Zillah in to help us, and we'd have a game at
blindman's-buff ; she should try to catch ua ; you used to, you
know, Ellen. He wouldn't : there was no pleasure in it, he
said ; but he consented to play at ball with me* We found
two in a cupboard, among a heap of old toys, tops, and
hoopd, and battledores and shuttlecocks. One was marked
id the other H. ; I wished tp have the G., because Ih^t

flSB
WUTHEKING HEIGHTS

stood for Catherine, and the H. might be for Heathcliff, h &
name ; but the btan came out of H., and Liuton didn't like
it. I beat him constantly : and he got croas again, and
coughed, and returned to his chair. That nighty though, he
easily recovered bis good humour : he waa charmed with two
or thr & e pretty sortg & ^-yonr songs, Ellen ; and when I wns ■
obliged to go, he begged and entreated me to come the
following evening ; and I promised. Minny and I weoi h
flying home as light as air; and I dreamt of WuthenB|^
Heights and my sweet, darling cousin, till morning.
'On the morrow I wae sad ; partly because you wait
poorly, and partly that I wished my father knew, & iid
approved of my excursions : but it was beautiful moonlight
ftfter tea ; and, as I rode on, the gloom cleared. I shall have
another happy evening, I thought to myself ; and what
delights me tnora^ my pretty Linton will. I trotted up their
garden, and was turning round to the back, when that fellow
Kamshaw met me, took my bridle, and bid me go in by tbe
front entrance. He patted Minny'a neck, and said she was a
bonny beast, and appeared as if he wanted me to speak (o
him, I only told him to leave my horii > e alone^ or else it
would kick him. He answered in his vulgar accent, " it
wouldn't do mitch hurt if it did ; ** and auiTeyed its legs with
a smile. I was half inclined to make it try ; however, be
moved off to open the door, and, aB be raised the latch, he
looked up to the inscription above, and said, with a stupid
mixture of awkwardness and elation: " Miss Catherine 1 i
can read yon^ now. "
* " Wonderful, " I exolalmed.'* Pray let us hear you—

familiarity, or what it really was, contempt. I settled his
[ doubts, by suddenly retrieving my gravity and desiring him

reddened— I saw that by the moonhght^— dropped his hand
from the latch, and skulked off, a picture of mortified vanity.
'He Imagined himself to be as accomplished as Linton, I
I suppose, liocause he could spell his own name ; and was
KLTvellously discomfited that I didn't think the same/
* Stop, Miss Catherine, dear ! * I interrupted. * I shall
t scold, but I don't like your conduct there. If you had
remeinbtsrod that Hareion was your cousin as much as
Master Heathcbff, you would have felt how improper it was
to behave in that way. At least, it was praiseworthy
ambitiion for him to doairo to bo as accompUshed as Linton ;
and probably ho did not learn merely to show off " you had
made him ashamed of bis ignorance beforo, I have no doubt ;
and he wished to remedy it and please you. To sneer at Ine
imperfect attempt was very bad breeding. Had jjoit boon
brought up in his circumstances, would you be less rude?
He was as quick and as intelligent a chiJd as ever you were ;
and I'm hurt that he should be despised now, because that
base Heathotiff has treated him so unjustly.*

exclaimod, surprised at my earnestness.'But wait, and you

breath to explain ; dragging her in, I looked about for
Linton. Eamshaw had coroe out to examine the mischief
he had caused, and he wafi then conveying Uie poor thing
up-stairs. ^illah and I ascended after him ; but he stopped
me at the top of the steps, and said I shouldn't go in : I must
go home. I exclaimed that he had killed Ejinton, and I
u^ould enter. Joseph looked the door, and declared I should
do " no sich stuflf, " and a & ked me whether I were " bahn to
be as mad as him. " I stood crying till the housekeeper
reappeared. She alBrmed he " vvould he better in a bit, but
he couldn't do with that shrieking and din ; and she took me,
ftnd nearly carried me into the house,
Ellen, I was ready to tear my hair off my head I I
bbed and wept so that my eyes were almost blind ; and the
ruffian you have Buch sympathy with stood opposite: pre-
Boming every now and then to bid me " wi & ht/'and denying
that it was his fault ; and, finally, frightened by my aBsertiona
that I would tell papa, and that he should be put in pnson
and hanged, he commenced blubbering himself, and hurried
out to hide his cowardly agitation. Stilly I was not rid of
him : when at length they compelled me to depart, and I had
got some hundred yards off the premises, he suddenly issued
from the shadow of the road-aide, and checked Minny and
took hold of me.
*'* Mias Catherine, I'm ill grieved, " he began, " but it's

would murder me. He let go, thundering one of his horrid

laid oo a Little sofa, reading one of my books. But he would
neither speak to me nor look at mer through a whole hoi

confounded mo, when he did open his mouth, it was to utt
the falsehood that I had occasioned the uproar, and Haret
was not to blame! Unable to reply, except passionately,
got up and walked from tlie room. He sent after me a fai
" Caihenno ! " He did not reckon on being answered sol
bub I wouldn't turn back ; and the morrow was the aecoi
day on which I stayed at home, nearly determined to

yet I was sorry Linton had that distorted nature. He*ll
never let his friends be at ease, and hell never be at ease
hijnself 1 I have always gone to his little parlour, since that

the former with nearly as little resentment as the latter.

at all. Last Sunday, indeed, coming earlier than usual, I
heard him abusing poor Linton cruelly for his conduct of
the night before. I can't tell how he knew of it, unless he
listened. Linton had certainly-behaved provokingly : how-

I thought it over aloud, in my master's presence ; walking
straight from her room to his, and relating the whole story :
with the exception of her conversations with her oousin, m &
any mention of Hareton, Mr, Linton was alarmed and
distressed, more than he would acknowledge to me. In
the morningp Catherine learnt my betrayal of her oonfidenoe,
and she learnt also that her secret visite wore to end. In
vain she wept and writhed against the interdict, and
implored her father to have pity on Linton ; all she gol to
comfort her was a promise that he would write and give bim
leave to come %o the Grange when he pleased ; but explain-
ing that he must no longer expect to see Catherine al
Wuthering Heights. TerhapB, had he been aware of his

fit to withhold even that shght consolation.

That part of his letter was simple, and probably hiB own*

avaricious and unfeeling plans were threatened with defeat
by death*

Bet out on our first ride to join her cousin. It was ti ciose,
sultry day : devoid of siinabiae, but with a sky too dapple
Euad hazy to threaten rain : and our place of meeting had
been fixed at the guide-etone^ by the cross-roada. On
arriving there, how & ver, a little herd-boy» despatched as a
naeaaenger, told ua that, — * Maister Linton wer just o^ ttis

* Then Master Linton has forgot the first injun < 5tioil of

and here we are off at once.*
'Well, we'll turn our horBea'heads round when we
reach him/ answered my companion ;'our excursion slmll
lie towards home/
But when we reached him, and that was scarcely a ■
quarter of a mile from his own door, we found he had no
horse ; and we were forced to dismount, and leave oura to
graze. He lay on the heJith, awaiting our approach, and
did Hot rise till we came within a few yards. Then ho
walked bo feebly; and looked bo pale, that I immediately
exclaimed, — *Why, Master Heathcliff, you are not fit fi
enjoying a ramble this morning. How ill you do look I *

linton did not appear to remember what Bho talked of ;
and he had evidently great difEculty in austaining any kind
of conversation. His lack of interest in the subjecta she
atartedf and his equal incapacity to contribute to her
entertainment^ were an obvious that she could not conceal her
disappoinbment. An indefinite alteration had come over his
whole person and manner. The pettiahness that might bo
careesed into fondness, had yielded to a listless apathy ;
there was less of the peevish temper of a child which frets
and teases on purpose to be soothed, and more of the self-
absorbed moroaenesa of a confirmed invalid, rapolUng
conaoltttion, and ready to regard the good-humoured mirth
of others as an insult. Catherine perceived, as well as 1 did,
that he held it rather a punishment, than a graCifioation, to
endure our company ; and she made no acruple of proposiixg,
presently, to depart. That proposal^ unexpectedly, roused
Linbon from his lethargy, and threw him into a strange stats
of agitation. He glanced fearfully towards the Heightfi,

'Stay to rest yonraelf,'he replied. * And, Caiherine,

*I'll tell him that you say bo, Linton. I couldn't afl^rm

— and, if you did meet my father, and he asked you about
me, don't lead him to suppose that IVe been extremely silent

'I care nothing for his anger,'exclaimed Cathy, Imagining
she would be its object.
* But I do/ said her cousin, shuddering* * Don^t provoke
him against me, Catherine, for he is very hard/
'Is he severe to you, Master Heathcliflf?* I inquired.
'Has he gro^^m weary of indulgence, and passed {rom

LJnton looked at me, but did not answer ; and, after
keeping her seat by his side another ten minutes^ during
which his head feU drowsily on his breast, and be uttered
nothing except suppressed moans of exhaustion or pun,
Cathy began to seek solace in looking for bilberriee, and
sharing the produce of her researches with me : she did not
oSer them to him, for ahe saw further notice would only
weary and annoy.

'There you differ with me, Misa Cathy,'I remarked ; * I

Linton, than when we separated in winter ? If you be, I'm

The tears gushed from Linton's eyes as h^ answered^
'Yes, yes, I am ! * And, still under the spell of the imaginary

Before we reached home, Catherine's displeasure softened
Into a perplexed sensation of pity and regret, largely blended
with vague, unea(?y doubts about Linton's aotual drcum*
itances, physical and social : in which I partook, thougb I
oounaelled her not to say much ; for a second journey would
make us better judges. My master requested an acooont d(

little light on his inquiries, fori hardly knew what to hide
and what to reveal.
CHAPTER XXVII
Sbvbn days glided awory, every one majJoog its courae by the
henceforth mpid alterartiou of Kdga^r Linton's state. The
havoc that moathe had previously \vTought was now emulated
by the inroads of hours. Catherine we would fain have
deluded yet : butber own quick spirit infused to delude her ;
it divined in secret, and brooded on the di-eadful probabitityj
graduQrlly ripening into Gertainty. She had not the heart to
mention her ride, when Thursday came round ; I mentioned
it foe her, aud obtained peruiiaslon to order her out of doors :
for the library^ where her father stopped a short time daily
— the brief period he could bear bo fiit up — and his chamber,
bod become her whole world. She grudged each moment
that did not find her beading over his pillow, or seated by his
Hide. Her countenance grew wan with watching and sorrow,
and my master gladly diamisaed her to what he flattered
himself would be a happy clui/Uge of scene and society ;
drawing comfort from the hope that she would not now be
left entirely alone after his death.
He bad a fixed idea, I guessed by several observations he
let fall, that, aa his nephew 1*68600 bled him in person, he
would resemble him in mind ; for Linton's letters bore few
or no indications of his defective character. And I, thi'ougb
pardonable weakness, refrained from cojTecting the error ;
aokiDg myself what good thei'a would be in disturbing bis
last momenta with information that he had neither power nor
opportunity to turn to aocount.

We discerned Linton'WAtching at the same spot be had

that, ofi she was resolved to stay a very little while, I hod
better hold the pony and rBmain on horseback ; but I
dissented : I wouldn't risk losing sight of the charge com-
mitted to me a minute ; so we olimbed the slope of heath
together. Master Heathchff received us with greats
animation on this ocoo^on : not the animation of high spiiite
though, nor yet of joy ; it looked more like fear.
'It is late I'he said, speaking short and with diflSculiy.
'Is not your father very ill? I thought you wouldn't come. "
* Why won*t you be candid ?'cried Catherine, swallowing
her greeting.'Why cannot you say at once you don't waat
me ? It is strange, Linton^ that for the Becond time you have
brought me here on purpose^ apparently to distress us bothp
and for no reason besides I'
Linton shivered, and gl & noed at bar, half supplicating,
half ashamed ; but his ooimn's patianoe was not sufficient to
endure this enigmatical behaviour.
* My father is v & ry iU,'she said ;'and why am I called
from his bedside ? Why didn't you send to absolve me from

*I don't know/ I said.
'Because/ he continued, looking at the two young people,
who were fixed under big eye — Linton appeared as if he
could not venture to stir or raise his head, and Catherine
could not move, on his account —'because that lad yonder

He approached once more, and made as if he would aeise
the fragile being; but, shrinking back, Linton clung to his

importunity that admitted no denial. However I disapproved,

Heathchff had the key in his hand that remained on the
table. He looked up, seized with a sort of surprise at her
boldness ; or, possibly^ reminded, by her voice and glanoe,
of the person from whom she inherited it. She snatched ai
the instrument, and half succeeded in getting it out oi his

back, and felt ready to suffocate, or to burst a blood-vesBel.
The scene was over in two minutes ; Catherine, releaaed, put
her two hands to her templeSj and looked just qm if she were
not sure whether her ears were off or on. She trembled like
a reedp poor thing, and leant against the table perfectly
bewildered.

struck me then, all the misfortunes of my employers sprang.
It was not the ctvse, in reality, I tun aware ; but it was, in

^uld pour forth to detain him.
And there I remained enclosed the whole day, and the

I considered it best to deptirt without seeing Mr*

Heathcliff forced me to go in : which was not quite true. I
uttered as little as possible against Linton ; nor did I

He divined that one of his enemy's purposes was to
secure the personal property, as well as the estate, to bis son :
or rather himself ; yet why he did not wait till his deceafio
was a puzale to my master, because ignorant how nearly ba
and his nephew would quit the world togtjther. However,
he felt that his will had better be altered : instead of leaving ■
Catherine's fortune at her own disposal, he dotermined to
put it in the hands of trustees for her use duriug life,
and for her children, if she had any, after her. By that
means, it could not fall to Mr. Heathcliff should Linton
die.

parties were delayed very late. The single sen'anfc returned
first. He said Mr. Green, the lawyer, was out wh & n he
arrived at his house, and he had to wait two hours for his
re-entraoce ; and then Mr. Green told him he had a Little
business in the village that must he done ; but he would be
at Thrughcross Grange before morning. The four men came
back unaccompanied alsO'They brought word that Catherine
was ill : too ill to quit her room ; and HeathcUtf would not
suffer them to see her. I scolded the stupid fellows well for
listening to that tale, which I would not carry to my master ;
resolving to take a whole bevy up to the Heights, at day-
light, and storm it literally, unless the prisoner were quietly
surrendered to ua. Her father sfiall see her, I vowed, and
vowed again, if that devil be killed on his owd doorstones in

Happily, I was spared the journey and the trouble. I
had gone down-stairs at three o'clock to fetcha jug of water;
and was passing through fchs hall with it in my hand, when
a sharp knock at the front door made me jump.'Oh ! it ia
Green,'I said, recollecting myscli—'only Green/ and I went
on, intending to send Bomebody else to open it ; but the
knock was repeated: not loud, and still importunately. I
put the jug on the banister and hastened to admit him
myself. The harvest moon shone clear outside. It was not

outeide the chaml)er-door a quarter of an boor, and hardly
ventured near the bed, then. All was composed, however:
Oathehne'e despair waa as silent aa her father's joy* She
supported him calmly, in appearance; and he fixed on her
features hia raised eyes that seemed dilating with ecstasy.

Mr. HeathclifF; that was the cause of his delay in obeying
my master's summons. Fortunately, no thought of worldly
afifaira crossed the letter's mind, to disturb himj after hia
daughter's arrival,
Mr. Green took upon himself to order everything and
everybody about the place. He gave aU the servants but
me, notioe to quit. He would have carried his delegated
authority to the point of insisting that Edgar Linton should
not be buried beaide his wife, but in the chapel, with his
family. There was the will, however, to hinder that, aad
my loud protestations against any infringement of its
directions. The funeral was hurried over ; Catherine, Mr«»

She told me that her anguish had at hbst sparred Linion
to incor the risk of liberating her. She heard the men I
sent disputing at the door, and she gathered the sense of
HeatholifiTs answer. It drove her desperate. Linton who
had been conveyed up to the little parlour soon after I
left, was terrified into fetching the key before his father
re-aeoended. He had the cunning to unlock and re-lock the
door, without shutting it ; and when he should have gone to
bed, he begged to sleep with Hareton, and his petition was
granted for once. Catherine stole out before break of day.
She dared not try the doors lest the dogs should raise an
alarm ; she visited the empty chambers and examined their
windows; and, luckily, lighting on her mother's, she got
easily out of its lattice, and on to the ground, by means of the
fir-tree close by. Her accomplice suffered for his share in
the escape, notwithstanding his timid oontrivanoes.
CHAPTER XXIX
The evemng after the funeral, my young lady and I were
BDated in the library ; now muaiog raDurnfuUy — one of oi
despairingly — oa our loss, now venturing conjectures u
to the gloomy future.
We hiwi just agreed the best destiny which could
ftwait Catherine would be a permission to continue regideni
at the Grange ; at leaat during Lintoa'a life : he being
allowod to join her there, and I to remain as housekeeper.
That Beemed rather too favourable an arrangemeut to be
hoped for ; and yet I did hope, and began lo cheer up tinder
the prospect of retaining my home and my employment, and,
above aU, my beloved young mistress ; when a servant — one
of the discarded ones^ not yet departed — rushed hastily bi
and said • that devil Heathcliff'was coming through the
court : should he fasten the door in his face?
If we had been mfwi enough to order that proceeding,
we had not time. He made no ceremony of knocking or
announcing his name : he was master^ and availed hitnselj
of the master's privilege to walk straight in, without saying
a word. The aound of our informant's voice directed him
to the library ; he entered and motioning him out, shut the
door.
It was the same room into which he had been UBhered,
as a guest, eighteen years before : the same moon shone
through the window ; and the same autumn landscape by
outside. We had not yet lighted a candle, but all the apart-
ment was visible, even to the portraits on the wall : the
splendid head of Mrs. Linton, ivnd the graceful one of her
husband, Heathcli£f advauced to the hearth. Time bad

hia daj^k face rather aaliower and more composed, his frame

Catherine h^ risen with an impulse to dash out, when she

seemed to have made up her mind to enter into the spirtt of

enemies,

be silent ; and then, for the first time, allowed himself a

'And if she had been dissolved into earthy or worse, what

taken up with staring at Catherine than thinking of Linton.
But the master bid him get off to b & d again : we didn't wan6

cliff remained by herself,
'In the tnorning, he sent me to tell her she must ooma

ai any rate, Catherine, destitute of c & ^h and friendSr cannot
disturb his possession.
* Nobody/ said Zillah,'ever approaohed her door, except
that onts & t but I^ and nobody asked anythiug about her.
The first occasion of her coming down into the house was on
a Sunday aft-emoon. She had cried out, when I oarriod up
her dinner, that she couldn't bear any longer being in the
cold ; and I told her the master was going to Tlmishoraga
Grange, and EarnBhaw and I needn't hinder her from
doBoending ; so. as soon as she heard HeaihclifTe horse trot

HaretoD, with all bis bashfulnesa, isn't a model of nice
behaviour. I let him know that his cousin would very likely
sit with UB, and she had been always used to see the Sabbath
respected : bo he had as good leave his guns and bits of in-
door work alone, while aho stayed. He coloured up at the
news, and cast his eyes over his hands and olothes. The
train-oil and gunpowder were shoved out of sight in a
minate. I saw he meant to give her his company ; and I
guessedj by his way^ he wanted to be presentable ; so,
laughing, as I durst not laugh when the master is by, I
offered to help him, if he Avould, and jbked at his coDfosion.
He grew sullen, and began to swear.

Hareton allowed ZiUah to give him her aid; and gha
flattered him into a good humour ; so, when Catherine came,
half forgetting her former insults, he tried to make himself
agreeable, by the houaekeeper'a account.
'Missis walked in,'she said, * as chill as an iciclep and a's
high as a princess. I got up and offered her my seat in the
arm-chair. No, she turned up her nose at my civility.
Bamshaw roae, too. and bid her come to the settle^ and sit
close by the tire : he was sure she was starved,
'" I've been starved a month and more/'& he answered,
resting en the word aa scornful aa she could.
'And she got a'c^hair for herself, and placed it at a dis-
tance from both of us. Ha\ing sat till she was warm, she
began to look round, and discovered a number of books on
the dresser ; she was instantly upon her feot again, stretching
to reach them : but they were too high up. Her couain,
after watching her endeavours a whilei at last summoned
courage to help her ; she held her (rock, and he filled it with
the first that came to hand.
'That was a great advance for the lad. She didn't thank
him ; stilly he felt gi-atiiied that she had accepted his assis-
tance, and ventured to stand behind as she examined them,
and even to stoop and point out what sbruck his fancy In
certain old pictures which they contained ; nor was he
daunted by the saucy style in which she jerked the page from
hia finger : he contented himself with going a bit farther back
and looking at her instead of the hook. She continued
reading, or seeking for something to read. His attention
became, by degrees, quite centred in the study of her thick
ailky curls ; her face he couldn't see, and she couldn't aea
him. And, perhaps, nob quite awake to what he did, but

'Mr. Hareton recoiled, looking as foolish as he could do;
he sat down in the settle very quiet, and she continued
turning over her volumes another half hour ; fiually, Eam-
8haw crossed over, and whispered to me.
'" Will you ask her to retwi to* us, ZiUah ? I'm stalled

said, immediately, " He'd take it very kind— he'd be much

'" Oh ! you are an eitoeption/'answered Mrs, Heathcltff.
" I never missed such a conoem aa you. "

DQCupations no longer. He talked now. freely enongh ; and
she presently saw fit to retreat to her solitude : but the frost

ont respect of any oue. She'll suap at the master himselff
and as good as dares him to thrash her ; and the more hurt
she gets, the more venomous she grows/
At Erst^ on hearing this account from n^illah, I determined
to leave my situation, take a cottage, and get Catherine to
come and live with me : but Mr. Heatbeliff would as soon
permit that as he would set up Hareton in an independent
house ; and I can see no remedy, at present, unless she
could marry again ; and that scheme it does not come within
my province to arrange.
'Thus ended Mrs. Dean's story* Notwithstanding the
doctor's prophecy^ I am rapidly recovering strength ; and
though it be only the second week in January, I propose
getting out on hoi'seback in a day or two, and riding over to

CHAPTEB XXXI
Tbstbbday was bright, calm, and frosty. I went to the
HeJghtB & s I proposed : my housekeeper entreated me to
bear a little not© from her to her young lady, and I did
not refuse, for the worthy woman was not coDBcious of
anything odd in her request. The front door stood open, but
the jealous gate was fastenedj as at my last visit ; I knocked
and invoked Eai'nsbaw from among the garden-bed» ; hd
nnohained it, and I entered. The fellow is as handsome $
rustic as need be seen. I took pELtticuIar notice of htm this
time ; but then he does bis best apparently to make the least
of his advantages,
I asked ii Mr. HeatholiGE were at home? Ha answered^
No ; but he would be in at dinner-time. It* was elevsn
o'clock, and I announcod my intention of going in and wail-
ing for him ; at whioh he immediately flung down hia tools
and accompanied me^ in the ofiQoe of watchdog, not aa a
substitute for the host.
We entered together ; Catherine was there, making beraalf
useful in preparing some vegetables for the approaching
meal ; she looked moie sulky and less spirited than when I
had seen her fii'st. She hai'dly raised her eyea to notice me,
and continued her employment with the same disregard to
commoD forma of politeness aa before ; never returning my
bow and good-morning by the slightest acknowledgment.

ber, pretending to desire a view of the garden; and, as I
Eanoied, adroitly dropped Mrs. Dean's note on to her knee,
lumotioed by Hareton — but she asked aloud,'What ia
that ? * And chucked it ofif,
'A letter from your old aoquaintanoe, the housekeeper at
the Grange/ I answered ; annoyed at her exposing my kind
deed, and fearful leat it should be imagined a missive of my
own. Bhe would gladly bavegathei^d it up at this iufortna-
^ou, but Hareton beat her ; he seized and put it in his

Thereat, Catherine silently turned her face from ug, and,
very stealthily, drew out her pocket-handkerchief and applied
it to her eyes; and her oousin, after BtiuggUng awhile to
keep down hig eofter feelings, puCed out the letter and flung
h on the floor beside her, as ungraciously as ho could.
Catherine caught and perused it eagerly ; then she put a few
questions to me oonoerning the inmates, rational and
Irrational* of her former home ; and gazing towards the hills,
murmured In aoliloquy :

The yotmg man evidently thought it too bad that he
should be laughed a,i for his ignorance, and then laughed at
for trying to remove it, I had a similar notion ; and,
remembering Mrs, Dean's anecdote of his £i*st attempt at
enlightening the darkne^a in which he had been reared, I
obeerved, —'But, Mrs. Heathcliff, we have each had a

them debased and profaned in his mouth I Besides, of all,
be has selected my favourite pieces that I love the most to

Hareton's chest heaved iu silence a minute : he laboured
tmder a severe sense of mortification and wrath, which it was
no easy task to suppress, I rose, andf from a gentlemanly
idea of relieving his embarrassment, took up my station in
the doorway^ surveying the external prospect as I stood.
He followed my example, and left the room ; but presently
reappeared, bearing half a dozen volumes in his hands, which
be threw into Catherine's lap, exclaiming, — * Take them ! I
never want to hear, or read, or think of them again t *
I won't have them now,'she answered, * I shall

She opened one that had obviously been oft^n turned

then laughed, and threw it from her.'And listen,'she con-
tinued, provokingly, commencing a verse of an old ballad in
the same fashion.

1802. — This September I wns invited to devastate the moors

nnespectedly came within fifteen miles of Gimmerton. The
ostler at a roadside pubUc-hotiso was holding a pail ol wotter
to refresh my horaes» when a cart of very green oats, newly
reaped, passed by, and he remarked, —'Yon's frough Gim-

* Gimmerton ?'I repeated — my residence in that locality
had already grown dim and dreamy* * Ah I I know. How
lar is it from this ? *
* Happen fourteen mile o'er th'hills ; and a rough road/
he answered.
A sudden impulse seized me to visit Thrushcroas Grange*
It was scarcely noon, and I conceived tb & t I might as welt
pass the night under my own roof as in an inn. Besides^ I
could spore a day easily to arrange matters with my land-
Lord, and thus save myself the trouble ol invading the
neighbourhood again. Having rested awhile, I directed my
Bervant to inquire the way to the village ; and, with great
fatigue to our beasts, wo managed the distance in some three
houTB.
I left him there* and proceeded down the valley alone.
The grey church looked greyer, and the lonely churchyard
lonelier. I distinguished a moor-sheep cropping the short
turf on the graves. It was sweet, warm wenther — too warm
for travelling ; but the heat did not hinder me from enjoying
the delightful scenery above and below -. had I seen it nearer
August, I'm sure it would have tempted me to waste a

month among its solitudes. In winter nothing mom dnuy,
in euntmer nothing more divine, than those ^os shnfc m faj

I reached the Grange before sunset, and knocked for
admittance ; but the family had retreated into the bftck
premises, I judged, by one thin, blue wreath, otirling from
the kitchen chlmaey, and they did not hear. I rode intotha
court. Under the porch, a girl of nine or ten sat knitting,
and an old woman reclined on the hou^osteps, smoMog i
meditative pipe.
'Is Mrs. De & Q within ?'I demanded of the danae.
'MiBtTess Dean 7 Nay ! * she anawcrod,'she doesa'k

She threw down her pipe and bustled lo, the girl
followed, and I entered too ; soon perceiving that her report
was true, and. moreover, that I had almost upset her wits by
my unwelcome apparition, I bade her be composed. Iwo^ld
go out for a walk ; and, meantime she must try to prepare &
corner of a eittuig-room for me to sup in, and a bedroom to
eleep in. No sweeping and dusting, only good fire anJ
dry sheets were necessary. She seemed wiUing to do bef
best; though she thruBt the hearth -brush into the grates b
mistake for the poker, and mahippropriated several other
articles of her craft : but I retired, confiding in her energy
for a resting-place against my return. Wuthering Heights
was the goal of my proposed excursion. An after'thoogbl
brought me back, when I had quitted the court.

along, with the glow of a sinking sun behindj and the mild
glory of a rising moon in front — one fading, and the other

Both doors and lattices were open ; and yet, as is usually
the case in a coal-district, a fiue red £re illumined the

the estra heat endurable. But the house of Wutheriug
Heights is BO large that the inmates have plenty of
space for withdrawing out of its in£uencG ; and accordingly
what inmates there were had stationed themselves not far
from one of the windows. I could both see them and hear
them talk before I entered, and looked and hsteoed in con-

ourioaity and envy, that grew as I lingered. " ^

to smoking with Joseph ; and they sat like automatons, oaa

stand her wicked nonsense, as he would have called it, the
younger doing hia best to seem to disregard it. On fine

to the reacue, when of a eildden hia fingers relaxed ; he
Bhifted his grasp from her head to her arm, and gazed
iDtently in her face. Then he drew his hand over his eyes,
Btood a moment to collect himself apparently, and turning
anew to Catherine, said, with asanmed calmness —'You must

I led my young lady out : she was too glad of her escape
to reBist; the other foUove^edp and Mr. HeathcUET had the
room to himself till dinner. I had counselled Catherine to
dine up^stairs; but, as goon as he perceived Jier vacant seat,
he sent me to call her. He spoke to none of us, ate very
little, and went out directly afterwards, intimating that he
should not return before evening.
The two new friends established themselves in the houso
during his absence ; where I beard Hareton sternly check
hia cousin, on her offering a revelation of her father-in-law's
conduct to his father. He said he wouldn't euffer a word to
be uttered in his disparagement : if he were the davil, it
didn't signify ; he would stand by him ; and he'd rather she
would abuse himself, as she used to, than begin on Mr <
Heathcliff. Catherine was waging cross at this ; but be
found means to make her hold her tongue^ by asking how
she would like him to speak ill of bar father ? Then she
comprehended that Earnshaw took the master's reputation
home to himself ; and waa attached by ties stronger than
reason could break— chains^ forged by habit, which it would be
cruel to attempt to loosen. She showed a good heart, thence-
forth, in avoiding both complaints and expressions of
^tipathy concerning Heathcliff; and confessed to me

they both appeared in a measure my children : I had long
been proud of one ; and now, I was sure^ the other would be
a source of equal saftiBfaction. His honest, warm, and
intelligent nature shook off rapidly the clouds of ignoranoe
and degradation in which it had been bred ; and Catherme's
BJnoere oommend & tions acted as a spur to his industry. His
brightening mind brightened his features, and added spirit
and nobility to their aspect: I could hardly fancy it the same
individual I had beheld on the day I discovered my little
Udy at Wuthering Heights, after her exp^itioD to the Crags.
While I admired and they laboured, dusk drew on, and with
it returned the master. He came upon us quite anexpectedl/r
entenng by the front way, and had a full \'iew of the whole
three, ere we could raise our heads to glance at him. Well,
I reflected, there was neyer a pleasanter, or more bamifdtf
sight; and it will be a buming sbatiie to scold theni. Tbe
red 6re light glowed on their two bonny heads, a»tid revealed
their faces animated with the eager interest of children : for,
though he was twenty-three and she eightetjn, each had so
muoh of novelty to feel and learn, that neither experienced
nor ei'inoed the sentimenta of sober disenchanted maturity.
They lifted their eyes together, to encounter Mr. Heath-
cliff: perhaps you have never remarked that their eyes are
precisely siniUar, and they are those of Catherine Eomshair.
The present Catherine has no other likeness to her, except
a breadth of forehead, and a certain arch of the nostril that
makes her appear rather haughty, whether she will or cot

wakened to unwonted activity. 1 euppoao this resemblance
disarmed Mr, Heathcliff : he walked to the hearth in evident
ELgitation ; but it quickly guhsided fia ho looked at the youag
man : or, I should say, altered its character ; for it was
there yet. He took the book from his hand, and glanced at
tho open page* then returned it without any observation ;
merely signing Catherine away : her companion lingered
very tittle behind her, and I was about to depart aJso, but he

said, alarmed at his manner ; though he was neither Ln danger
of losing his senses, nor dying, according to my judgmeat^
he was quite strong and healthy ; and, as to his reason, from
childhood he had a delight in dwelling on dark things, and
entertaining odd fancies. He might have had a monomaiui

Fob some days after that evening Mr. Heathcliff shunned
meeting us at me^s ; yet he would not consent formally to
exclude Hareton and Cathy. Hg had nu aversion to yield-

himself; and euting once in twenty-foiii hours seemed
Buflicient sustenance for him.
One night, after the family were in bed, I heard him go
downstaiFB, and out at the front door. I did not bear him

After breakfast, Catherine insisted on my bringing a chair
and sitting with my work under the fir-trees at the 63id d

leoovered from his accident, to dig and an-ange her little
garden, which wa,8 shifted to that comer by the inBuenoe of
Joseph's complaints. I was comfortably revelling in the
spring fragrance around, and the beautiful soft blue orerheftd,
when my young laJy, who had run down near the gat^ W

it proper, though uusummonad, to carry a candle and hia

lattice, but not looking out : his face was turn & d to the
interior gloom, The fire had smouldered to ashes ; the
room was filled with the damp^ mild air of the cloudy
evening ; and bo still, that not only the murmur of the beck
down Gimmertou was distinguishable, but its ripples and its
gurgling over the pebbles, or through the large stones which
it could not cover. I uttered an ejaculation of discontent
a,t Boeing the dismal grate, and commenced ghutting the

to get through ; and it stniok me that be plotted another
midoight eicuraion, of which he bad rather we had no
suspicion.
'Is he a ghoi;il or a vampire ?'I mused. I had raad d
such hideous tDcamate demons. Aad then I aet myself to
reflect how I had tend & d bizn in infancy, and watched him
grow to youth, and followed him almost through his whole
oourae ; and what absurd nonsense It was to yield to thftt
aense of horror.'But where did he come from, the little
dark thing, harboured by a good man to his bane?'
muttered Superstition, a & I dozed into uncon & ciou & nefls.
And I began, half dreaming, to weary myself with imagining
■ome fit parentage for him ; and, repeating my wakin|
meditations, I tracked his existence over again, with grim
variations ; at last, picturing his death and funeral : of
which, all I can remember is, being exceedingly vexed ftt
having tbe task of dictating an inscnption for bis moDument,
and consulting the sext-on about it ; and, aB he had no

came true : we were. If you enter the Mrkyard, yon*U read,
on his headstone, only that, and the date of his death.

supposed, surveying one particular portion, up and dowDi
with glittering, reatleHS eyes, and with such eager interest

Still, I involuntarily obeyed him, as if I was not quitd

at aomethiag within two yards'distance. And whatever it
was, it communicated, appiu*ently,'both pleasure and pain in
exquisite extremes : at least the anguished, yet raptured,
expression of hie countenance suggested that idea. The
fancied object was not fised, either : his eyes pursued it with
unwearied diligence, and, even in speaking to me, were never
weaned awiiy. I vaialy reminded him of his protracted

did not retire to rest till late, and when I did, I could do*

too irksome to lie there, harassing my brain with a huJidred

'I believe you think me a fiendj* he said, with his dismal
laugh :'something too horrible to lire under a decent roof.*
Then turning to Catherine, who was there, and who drew
behind me at his approach^ he added, half sneeringly,—

flesh and blood to bear — even mine.'
He solicited the society of no one more. At dusk he
went into his chamber. Through the whole night, and far
into the morning, we heard him groaning and ttiurmunng to
himself. Hareton was anxious to enter ; but I bid him
fetch Mr. Kenneth, and he should go in and see him.
When he came, and I requesfcod admittance and tried to open
the door, I found it locked; and Heathaliff bid U9 be damned.
He wnB better, and would be left alone ; so the doctor went
away.
The following evening was very wet : indeed, it poured
down till day-dawn ; and, as I took my morning walk round
the house, I observed the mastei^s window swinging open,
and the rain driving straight in. He cannot be in bed, I
thought ; those showers would drench him through. Ho
must either be up or out. But I'll make no more ado, I'll
go boldly and look,*
Having succeeded in obtaining entrance with another
key, I ran to unclose the panels, for the chamber was vacant ;
quickly pu & hing tb & m aside, I peeped in, Mn Hetithclill
was there — laid on his back. His eyes met mine so keen
and fierce, I started ; Eusd then he seemed to smile. I could
not think him dead : but his face and throat were washed
with rain ; the bed-clothes dripped, and he was perfectly
stilL The lattice, flapping to and fro, had grazed one hand
that rested on the sill; no blood trickled from the broken
skin, And when I put my fingers to it, I could doubt no
more : he was dead and stark !
I hasped the window ; I combed his black long hair from
his forehead; I tried to close his eyes: to extinguish, if
possible, Uiat frightful, lite-like ga^e of exultation before any
one else beheld it. They would not shut : they seemed to
sneer at my attempts ; and his parted lips and sharp white
teeth sneered too ! Taken with another fijj of cowardice, I
cried out for Joseph* Joseph shuESed up and made a noi^e,
but resolutely refused to meddle with him.

every rainy night since his deEith : — and an odd thing
happened to m6 £ibout a month ago. I was going to the
Grange one eveniBg — a dark evening, threatening thunder
— and, just at the turn of the Heights, I eneotintered a little
boy with a sheep and two lambs before him ; he wo^ crying
terribly ; and I supposed the lambs were skittish, and would
not be guided.
'What is the matter, my little man ?'I asked.
* There *s Heathcliff and a woman yonder, under t* nab,'
he blubbered,'un'I damut pass'em.*
I saw nothing ; but neither the sheep nor he would go on ;
BO I bid him take the road lower down. He probably raised
the phantoms from thinking, as he traversed the moors alone,
on the nonsense he had heard his parents and companions
repeat. Yet, Btill, I don't like being out in the dark now ;
and I don't like being left by myself in this grim house : I
cannot help it ; I shall be glad when they leave it, and shift
to the Grange.
'They are going to the Grange, then?'I said.
'Yes/ answered Mrs. Dean,'as soon as they are married,
and that will be on New Year's Day/
'And who will live here then 7 *
'Why, Joseph will take cars of the bouse, and, perhaps,
a lad to keep him company. They will live in the kitchen,

observed,
* No, Mr. Lookwood/ said Nelly, shaking her head.'I
believe the dead are at peace ; but it is not right to speak of
them with levity,'

were returning.

My walk home was lengthened by a diversion in the n
direction of the kirk. When beneath its walla, I peredve4
decay had made progress, even in seven moDths : zitany &
window showed black gaps deprived of glaga ; and slates
jutted off, hero and there, beyond the right line of the rool,
to be gradually worked off in coming autumn storms.
I sought, and soon discovered, the three headstones OQ
the slope nest the moor : the middle one grey, and hall
buried in heath; Edgar Linton's only harmonized by the
turf and moss creeping up its foot ; Heathcliff's still bare.
I lingered round them, under that benign sky : watched
the moths fiuttenng among the heath and harebells, listened
to the soft wind breathing through the grass, and wondered
how any one could ever imagine unquiet slumbers for the
eleepers in that quiet earth.

CHAPTER I
THE PABBONAOE
tme histories contain instruction ; though, in some, tho
treasure may be hard bo find^ and when found, so trivial in
quantity, that the dry, shrivelled kernel scarcely compensated
for the trouble of cracking the nut. Whether this be tha
ease with my history or not, I am hardly competent to judge.
I sometimes think it might prove useful to some, and
entertaining to others ; but the world may judge for itself.
Shielded by my own obscurity, and by the lapse of years, and
a few fictitious namea, I do not fe£X to venture ; and will
candidly lay before the public what I would not disclose to
the most intimate friend.
My father was a clergyman of the north of England, who
wae deservedly respected by all who knew him : and, in his
youngeT days, lived pretty comfortably on the joint income
of n email incumbency and a snug little property of his own.
My mother, who married him against the wishes of her
friends, waa a sijuire a daughter, and a woman of spirit. In
vain it was repreaeuted to her, that if she became the poor
parson's wife, she must relinquish her carriage and her tady's-
maid, and all the luxuries and elegancies of affluence ; which
to her were little less than the necessaries of life. A carriage
and a lady's-maid were great conveniences ; but, thank
heaven, she had foat to carry her, & ad h^ads to minister to

556
AGNES GREY
her own neeeSBittcB. An elegant house and spacious groirnlT
were not to be despised ; but she would rather live in a
cottage with Bichord Grey than in a palace with any other
man in the world.
Finding argutnentB of no avail, her father, at length, told
the lovers they might marry if they pleased ; hut, in so doing,
hJ9 daughter would forfeit every fraction of her fortune. He _
expected tliis would cool the ardour of both ; but he was mis- ■
taken. My father knew too well my mother's superior worth
not to be sensible that she was a valuable foilune in her^lf'-
and if she would but consent to embellish his bamblo hearth
he should be happy to take her on any terms ; while she, on
her part, would rather labour with her own hands than be
divided from the man she loved, whose happiness it would be
her joy to make, and who was already one with her in he & rt
and soul. Bo her fortune went to Bwell the purse of a wiser
sister, who had mamed a lich nabob ; and she^ to the wonder
and compassionate regret of all who knew her, went to bury
herself in the homely village parsonage among the hills of- •,
And yetp in spite of all this, and in spite of my mother's high
spirit and my father's whims, I believe you might search all
England through, and fail to hnd a happier couple.
Of six children, my sister Mary and myself were the only
two that survived the perils of infancy and early childhood.
I, being thti younger by five or six years, was always regarded
as the child, and the pet of the family : father, mother, and
sister, all combined to spoil me — not by foolish indulgence, to
render me fractious and ungovernable, but by cea & eleBB kind-
nesSf to make me too helpless and dependent — too unfit for ■
buffeting with the cares and turmoils of life. ™
Mary and I were brought up in the strictest seclusion. My
mother, being at once highly accomplished, well informed, and
fond of employment, took the whole chai'ge of our educatioD
on herself, with the eitception of Latin^which my father
undertook to teach us — so that we never even went to schoo) ;
and, as there was no society in the neighbourhood, our only
LutcrcourBe with the world ccnsisted in a, stately left^party,
AGNES GREY

I aw*
now Q^nd then, with tho pdncipa.! farmora and U^deapeople
of the vicinity (just to avoid being stigmatized as too proud
to consort with our neighbours), aad an annual visit to our
patomal grandfather's ; where himeolf, our kind grandmamma,
a maiden aunt, and two or thre^ elderly ladies and gentlemen,
were the only persons we ever saw. Sometimes our mother
would amuse us with storieB and anecdotes of her younger
days, which, while they entertained us amazingly, frequently
awoke— In ?»£, at least — a secret wish to see a little more of
Q world.
I thought she must have been very happy : but she never
med to regret past times. My father, however, whose
temper waa neither tranquil nor cheerful by nature, often un-
duly vexed hJmaelf with thinking of the sacrifices his dear
wife had made for him ; and trouhled his head with revolving
endless schemes for the augmentation of his little fortune,
for her sake and ours. In vain my mother assured him ghe
was quite satisfied ; and if he would but lay by a little for
the children, we should all have plenty, both for time present
and to come : but saving was not my father's forte. He
would not ran in debt (at least, my mother took good care
he should aot)» but while he had money he must spend it :
he liked to see his house comfortable, and his wife and
daughters well clothed, and well attended ; and besides, he
was charitably disposed, and liked to give to the poor, accord-
ing to his means : or, as some might think, beyond them.
At length, however, a kind friend suggested to him a
means of doubling his private property at one stroke ; and
further increasing it^ hBreafter^ to an untold amount. This
friend was a merchant^ a man of enterprising spirit and un-
doubted talent, who was somewhat stiaitened in his mercan-
tile pursuits for want of capital ; but generously proposed to
give my father a fair share of his profits, if he would only
entrust him vrith what he could spare ; and he thought he
might safely promise that whatever sum the latter chose to
put into his hands, it should bring him in cent, per cent. The
amall patrimony waa speedily sold, and the whole of its

366
AGNES GREY
pnoe wfts deposited in the hands of tho friendly merohant ;
who as promptly proceeded to ship his cargo, and prep & iv
for his voyage.
My father was delighted, so were wo all, with ooj
brightening prospG€t«, For the present, it ia true, we were
reduced to the narrow income oi the cur & cy ; but my fjither
ieemed to think there vi & s no necessity for scrupulously
restricting our expenditure to that ; so, with a standing blU «t
Mr. Jackson's, another at Smith's, and a third at Hobson'^,
we got along even cQore comfortably tha,n before : though m >
mother affirmed we had better keep within bounds, for our
pTospecU of wealth were but precarious, after all ; and if my
father would only trust everything to her management, he
should never feal him & elf stinted : but he» for onoe, wjis
incorrigible.
What happy hours Mary and I havo paaaed while Bitting
at our work by the fire, or wandering on the heath-clad hitla,
or idling under the weeping birch (the only considerable tree
in ths garden}, talking of future happiness to ouiselvefl and
our parents, of what we would do^ and see, and possess,
with no firmer foundation for our goodly super & tniGture
than the riches that were eitpected to flow in upon ns from
the success of the worthy merchant's speculations. Our
father was nearly as bad as ourselves ; only that he affected
not to be so much in earnest : espressing his bright hopes
and sanguine expectations in jests and playful sallies, ihu
always struck me aa being dxoeeilingly witty and ple &'
aant- Our mother laughed with delight to se^ him ao
hopeful and happy : but still she feared he was setting his
heart too much upon the matter ; and once I heard her
whisper as she left the room,'God grant he be not difr*
appointed I I know not how he would hear it/ H
Disappointed he was ; and bitterly, too. It came tike i^^
thunder-clap on us all, that the vessel which contained our
fortune had been wrecked, and gone to the bottom with all
ite stores, together with several of the crew, and the unfor-
tunate merchant himself. I was grieved Ux him ; I was

AGNES GHE7
grieved for the overbhrow of all our air*built CEi & tles : but^
with the elasticity of youth, I aoon recovered the ahock.
Though riches had charms, poverty had do terrors for an
inexperienced girl like me. Indeed, to say the truth, there
was BOmethiiig exhilarating in the idea of being driven to
straits, and thrown upon our own resources. I only wished
papa, manima» and Mai'y were all of the same mind aa
myself ; and then, iaatoad of lamenting past calamittea we
cnight all cheerfully set to work to remedy them ; and the
greater the difBculties^ the harder our present privations, the
greater should be our cheerfulness to endure the latter, and
our vigour to contend against the former.
Mary did not lament, but she brooded continually over the
misfortunGj and sank into a state of dejection from which no
effort of mine could rouse her. I could not possibly bring her
to regard the matter on its bright aide as I did : and indeed
I wag 80 fearful of being charged with childish frivolity^ or
stupid insensibility, that I carefully kept most of my bright
ideas and cheering notions to myself ; well knowing they
could not be appreciated.
My mother thought only of consoling my father, and
paying our debts and retrenching our expenditure by every
available means ; but my fatkei'was completely overwhelmed
by the calamity : health, strength, and spirits sank beneath
the blow, and ho never wholly recovei'ed them. In vain my
mother strove to cheer him, by appealing to his piety, to his
couragep to his aOection for herself and ua. That very & £rec-
tion was his greatest torment : it was for our sakes he had
so ardently longed to increase his fortune— it was our
interest that had lent such brightneea to his hopes, and that
imparted such bitterness to his present distreas. He now
torraented himself with remorse at hanng neglected my
mother's advice ; which would at least have saved him from
the additional burden of debt — he vainly reproached himself
for having brought her from the dignity, the ease, the luxury
of her former station to toil with him through the cares and
toils of poverty. It was gall and wormwood to hia soul to

360
AGNES GREY
see that aplendid, highly-accompLiahed woman^ onoe ea
courted and admired, trajiBforined into an active managing
housewife* with hands and head continually occupied with
household labours and houaehold economy. The very will*
ingneBS with which she performed these duties^ the cheer-
fulnesa with whioh she bore her revei " aes, and the kijadness
which mthheld her from imputing the smallest blame to
him, were all perverted by this ingenious self-tormentor into
further aggravations of his sufferings. And thu^ the mind
preyed upon the body, and disordered the system of the
Qcrvos^ and they in turn increaaod the troubles of the misd,

and not one of us could convince him that the aspect of our

morbid imagination represented it to be«
The useful pony phaeton was sold, together with ihe
stout, well'fod pony— the old favourite that wo had fnih*
determined should end its days in peace» and never pusi
from our hands ; the little coach-house and stable were let :
the servant boy, and the more efficient (being the rnotu
expensive) of the two maid-servants, were disn^ssed. Dor
clothes were mended, turned, and darned to the utmost
verge of decency; our food, always plain, was now simplified
to an unprecedented degree — except my fathered favourite
dishes ; our coals and candles were painfully econozDis & d-^
the pail of candles reduced to one, and that most sparingly
used ; the coals carefully husbanded in the balf-enipty
grate : especially when my father wag out on his pariftlti
duties, or coniined to bed through illness— then we sat with
our feet on the fender, scraping the perishing em] > ers together
from time to time, and occasionally adding a slight scattering
of the dust and fragments of coal» just to keep them aliTO.

one servant-girl, was dono by my mother and siater, with a
little occasiona,! help from me : only a little, because, though
a woman in my own estimation, I was still a child in theirs ;
and my mother^ like most active, managing women, was nob
gifted with very active daughters : for this reason — that
being so clever and diligent herself, she was never tempted
to trust her affairs to a deputy, but, on the contrary, was
willing to act and think for others as well as for number
one ; and whatever was the buBinoss in hand, she was apt to
think that no one could do it so well as herself : so that
whenever I offered to assist her, I received such an answer
as —'No, love, you oannot indeed — there's nothing here you
can do* Go and help your sister, or get her to take a walk
with you — tell her she roust not sit so much, and stay ao
constantly in the houBo aa she does— she may well look thin

['Mary, mamma says I'm to help you ; or get you to tako
a walk with me ; she saya yon may well look thin and
dejected, 11 you sit so constantly in the house.'
I* Help me you cannot, Agnes ; and I cannot go out with
you— I have far too much to do*'
'Then let me help you/
'You cannot, indeed, dear child. Go and practise your
XDHflic, or play with the kitten.'
There was always plenty of Sewing on hand ; but I had
not been taught to cut out a single garment^ and except plain
hemming and seaming, there was little I could do, even in
that line ; for they both asserted that it was far easier to do
»tho work themselves than to prepare it for me : and liesides,
Ihey liked better to see me prosecuting my etudies, or
frmuaing myself^-it was time enough for me to sit beading
over my work, like a gi^ve matron, when my favourite little
pussy was become a steady old cat. Under such circum-
stances, although I was not many degrees more useful than
the kitten, my idleness was not entirely without escuae.
Through all our troubles, I never but once heard my
mother complain of our want of money. As summer was

you see, there's no money, " she added, with a sigh. We both
wished exceedingly that the thing might be done, and
lamented greatly that it could not.'Well, well ! * said ahe^
'it's no use complaining. Possibly something might be done

your best style, and getting them fiamod, with the water-

dispose of them to some liberal picture-dealer, who has the
sense to discern their merits ?'
'Mamma, I should be delighted if you think they ooM
be sold ; and for anything worth while.*
* It's worth while trying, however, my dear ; do you
procure the drawings, and I'U endeavour to find a puj-
chaser.'
'I wish / could do something/ Baid I.
'You, Agnes! well, who knows? You dmw pretty weU*
too : if you choose some simple piece for your subject, I dare-
say you will be able to produce something we shall all be
proud to exhibit.*
'But I have another scheme in my head, mamma, and
have had long, only I did not like to mention it.'
* Indeed ! pray tell us what it is.'
'I should like to be a governess.'
My mother uttered an exclamation ot surprise, and
laughed. My sister dropped her work in astonishment,
exclaiming,'You a governess, Agnea I What can you bo

full of strangers, without me or mamma to speak and act for
you — with a parcel of children, besides yourself, to attend
to ; and no one to look to for advice ? You would not even
know what clothes to put on/
* You think, because I always do as you bid me, I have
O judgment of my own : but only try me — that is all I ask
— and you shall see what I can do.*
At that moment my father entered and the subject of our
discussion was explained to him.
* What^ my litfcle Agnes a governess !'cried he, and, in
ite of his dejection^ he laughed at the idea.
* Yes^ papa, don't you say anything against it: I should
like it so much ; and I am sure I could manage delightfully,*
* But, my darlingj we could not spare you.'And a tear
glistened in his eye as he added —'No, no I afflicted as we
are, surely we are not brought to that pass yet/
* Oh, no ! * said nay mother.'There is no necessity what-
ever for such a step ; it ia merely a whim of her own. So
you must hold your tongue, you naughty girl \ for, though
you are so ready to leave its, you know very well we cannot
part with you,*
I was silenced for that day, and for many succeeding
ones ; but atill I did not wholly relinquish my darling schema

Influenced by go many inducements, I determined still to
persevere ; though the fear of displeasing my mother, or
distressing my falher^s feolingg, prevented me from resuming
the subject for several daya. At length, again, I mentioned
it to tny mother in private ; and, with some difficulty, got
her to promise to assist me with her endeavours. My
father*fl reluctant consent was next obtained, and then,
though Mary still sighed her disapproval, my dear, kind
mother began to look out for a situation for me. She wrote
to my father's relations, and consulted the newspaper adver-
tisements — her own relations she had long dropped all
communication with : a formal interchange of occasional
letters was aU she had ever had since her marriage, and she
would not at any time have applit^d to them in a case of. ^3
nature. But so long and bo entire had been my parvtits'
aecluaion from the worlds that many weeks elapsed before a
suitable situation could be procured. At tant, to my great
joy, it was decreed that I should take charge of the youn^

the packing of my trunks I But there was a feeling of
bittemesB mingling with the latter occupation too ; and when
it was done — when all was ready for my departure on the
morrow, and the last night at home approach & d — a sudden
anguish seemed to swell my heart* My d«ar friends looked
BO sad^ and spoke eo very kindly, that I could scarcely keep
my eyes from overflowing : but I still affected to be gay, I
had taken my last ramble with Mary on the moors, my last
walk in the garden^ and round the houae ; I had fed^ with
her, our pet pigeons for the last time — the pretty creaturea
ihat we had tamed to peck their food from our hands : I had
given a farewell stroke to all their silky backs as they crowded
in my lap. I had tenderly kissed my own peculiar
favonntes, the pair of snow-white fantails; I had played my
last tune on the old familiar piano^ and sung my last song to
papa : not the last, I hoped, but the last for what appeared
to me a very long time. And, perhaps, when I did these .
things again, it would be with different feelings; circum- \
stances might be changed, and this house might never be " ^^
my settled home again. My dear little friend, the kitten^
would certainly be changed : she was already growing a
fine cat; and when I returned, even for a hasty visit at
Christmas, would, most likely, have forgotten both her
playmate and her merry pranks. I had romped with h & r

3G6
AGNES GREY
for the last time ; and when I stroked her soft bright fEr,
while she lay purring herself to sleep in sqj lap, it wae with
a feeling of sadness I could not ea & ily disguise, Then at bed-
time, when I retired with Mary to our quiet httle chamber,
where already my drawers were cleared out and iny share of
the bookcaae wels empty— ^and where, hereiiftBr, she would
have to sleep eJone, in dreary solitude^ as she expressed it
—my heart sank more than ever : I felt as if I had heeii
selfish and wrong to persiat in leaving her; and when 1
knelt onoe more beside our little be^, I prayed for a blessing
on her and on my parents more fervently than ever I had
done before. To conceal my emotion, I buried my face in
my hauds^ and they were presently ba-thed in tean, I
perceived, on riaing; that she had been crying too : but
neither of ua spoke ; and in silence we betook oiirselvefi to
our repose, creeping more closely together from the con^ious-
nesa that we were to part so soon.
But the morning brought & renewal of hope and spirite.
I was to depart early ; that the conveyance which took qm
(ft gig, hired from Mr. Smith, the draper, grocer, and tea-
dealer of the village] might return the same day^ I ro & e,
washed, dressed, swallowed a hasty breakfastp received the
fond embraces of my fiither, mother^ and siater^ kissed
the cat — to the great scandal of Saliy^ the maid — shook
hands with her, mounted the gig, drew my veil over my faoe,
and then, but not till th^ri, burst into a flood of tears. The
gig rolled on ; I looked back ; my dear mother & nd sister
were still standing at the door, looking after me, and waving
their adieux. I returned their salute, and prayed God to
bless them from my heart : we descended the hill, and I
could see them no more.
* It's a coldish momio'for you, Miss Agnes/ obserred
Smith ; * and a darkecme'un too ; but we's happen get to
yon spot afore there come much rain to signify/
'YeSj I hope so,'replied I^ as calmly as I could,
'It's coined a good sup last night too.'
-Yes/

I

'But this cold wind will happen keep it off.'
'Perhaps it will.'
Here ended our colloquy. We crossed the valley, and
began to ascend the opposite hill. As we were toiling up,
I looked back again ; there was the village spire, and the
old grey parsonage beyond it, basking in a slanting beam of
sunshine — it was but a sickly ray, but the village and
surrounding hills were all in sombre shade, and I hailed the
wandering beam as a propitious omen to my home. With
clasped hands I fervently implored a blessing on its inhabi-
tants, and hastily turned away ; for I saw the sunshi]^ was
departing; and I carefully avoided another glance, lest I
should see it in gloomy shadow, like the rest of the land-
scape.
CHAPTER n
FIBST LESSONS IN THB ART OF OrSTBUCTlOlf
As w^Mrove along, mj spirits revir^ ^ & iti, and I turned,
with pleasure, to tfaa contemplation of the new life upon
which I was enteriBg. But though it was not i & x past ibe
□uddk of September, the heavy clouds & nd strong north*
easterly wind combined to render the day extremely cold and
dreary ; and the journey seemed a very Long one, for, afl
Smitii obserredt the rdods were'very heavy'; and certainly,
hia horse was very heavy too : it crawled up the hills, and
crept down them, and only oondesoended to shake its sides
in a trot where the road was at a dead level or a very gentle
slope, which was rarely the case in those rugged regions; & o
that it was nearly one o'clock before we reached the place of
OUT destination. Yet, after all, when we entered the lofty
iron gateway, when we drove softly up the smooth, well-
roLled carriage- road, with the g^een lawn on each fildef studded
with young trees, and approached the new but stately
mansion of Wellwood, riaing above its mushroom poplar-
groves, my heart failed me, and I ^shed it were a mile or
two farther off. For the first time in my life I must stand
alone : there was no retreating now, I must enter that
house, and introduce myself among its strange inbabitants.
But how was it to be done? Tt^e, I was near mneteen;
, bui» thanks to my retired life and the protecting tsare of my
mother and ^ster, I well knew that many a girl of fifteeQ,
or under, was gifted with a more womanly address, and
greater ease and self-possession, than I was- Yet, if Mrs.
£Ioom£eld were a kind, motherly woman, I might do very

I after all ; and the childrenp of coursOj I should soon bo
at ease with them — and Mr. Bloomfield, I hoped, I abould
have but little to do with.
'Be calm, bo cairn, whatever happens,* I aaid within
myself ; and truly I kept tbia Fesolution so well, and waa so
fully occupied in steadying my nervea and stilling the rebel-
iioufl flutter of my heart, that when I was admitted into the
hall and ushered into the presenoe of Mrs, Bloorafield, I
almost forgot to answer her polite salutation ; and it after-
wards struck me, that the little I did say was spoken in the
tone of one half-dead or half-asleep. The lady, too^ was some-
what chilly in her manner^ as I discovered when I had time
^^ to reflect. She was a tall, spare, stately woman, with thick
^■black hair, cold grey ejQS, and extremely sallow ccm-
^v|}lexion«
^^ With due politeneas, however, ehe showed me my bed-
F room, and left me there to take a little refreshment. I was
^^ somewhat dismayed at my appearance on looking in the
^BglagiS : the cold wind bad swelled and reddened my hands,
^^ uncarled and entangled my hair, and dyed ray face of a pal^'
purple ; add to thia my collar was horridly crunipWd, my
frock Bplaahed with mud, nay feet clad in stout new boots,
and as the trunks were not brought up, there was no remedy ;
so having Bmoothed my hair as well as I could, and rcpeat-
I ©dly twitched my obdurate collar, I proceeded to clomp down
1 the two flights of stairs* philoaophiaing as I went ; and with
^bsome difficulty found my way into the room where Mrs.
^^ Bloomfield awaited me.
I She led me into the dining-room, where the family
luncheon had been laid out. Some beefsteaks and hall-
cold potatoes were get before me ; and while I dined upon
these, she sat opposite, watching me (as I thought) and
endeavouring to sustain something like a conversation — con-
sisting chiefly of a succGSslon of commonplace remarks, ex-
pressed with frigid formality : but this might lje more my fault
than hers, for I really could not eonvorae* In fact, my atten-
tion was almost wholly absorbed in my dinner : not from



AGNKS GREY
rOfVencus appetite, but from distress at the totlghness of the
heefsteaks, and thd numbaesfl of my hands, almost palled
by their five-hours'exposure to the bitter wii^. I would
gladly buve eaten the potatoes and let the meat atone, but
haviog got a large piece of the latter on to my platet I could
not be 80 impolite aa to leave it ; 90, after many awkward
and unsuoGGSsful attempts to cut it with the knife, or tear it
with the fork, or poll it asunder between them, sensible tbab
the awful lady was a spectator to the whole tranaaction, I at
last desperately grasped the knife and fork in my fists, like
a child of two years old, and fell to work with all the little
Btrepgth I possessed, Bui this needed some apology — with
a feeble attempt at a taugh, I said, * My hands are so
1»onumbed wit±i the cold that I can scarcely handle my knife
and fork/
'I daresay yon would find it cold/ replied she with a
cool, immutable gravity that did not serve to re-assure me.
When the cerctnony was coneludedj she led me into
the dttlng-room again, where she rang and sent for the
obildren*
* You will find them Bot very far advanced m their
attainments/ said she. * for I have had so little time to attend
to their education myself, and we have thought them too
young for a governess till now ; bub I think they are clever
children, and very apt to learn, especially the little boy ; he
is, I think, the flower of the flock — a generous, noble- spirited
boy, one to be led, but not driven, and remarkable for always
Bpeaking the truth. He seems to scorn deception'(this
was good aews)« * His sister Mary Ann will require watching/
continued she,'bat she is a very good girl upon the whole;
though I wish her to be kept out of the nursery as much
ae possible, as she is now almost six years old, and might
acquire bad habits from the nurses. I have ordered her
crib to be placed in your room, and if you will be so kind
as to overlook her waf^hing and dressing, and take charge
of her clothes^ she need have nothing further to do with the
nursei^ maid/

I replied I was quite willing to do bo ; and at that moment
toy young pupils entered the apartment, with their two
younger sisters. Master Tom Bloomfield was a well-grown
boy of seven, with a somewhat wiry frame, flaxen hair, blue
eyes, small tumed-up nose, and fair complexion, Maiy Ann
was a tall girl too, somewhat dark like her mother, but with
a round full face and a high colour in her cheeky, The
second sister was Fanny, a very pretty Little girl ; Mrs.
Bloomfield assured me she was a remarkably gentle child,
& nd required encouragement : she had not learned anytlnng
yet ; but in a few days, she would be four years old, and
then she might take her first lesson in the alphabet, and be
promoted to the schoolroom. The remaining one was
HaxTietp a little broad, fat, merry, playful thing of scarcely
two, that I coveted more than all the rest — but with her I
bad nothing to do.
I talked to my little pupils as well as 1 could, and tried
to render myself agreeable ; hut with little Buccess I fear,
for their mother's presence kept me under an unpleasant
restraint. They, however, were remarkably free from shy-
nesB. They seemed bold, lively cliildren, and I hoped I
should soon be on fnendly terms with them — the little boy
especially, of whom I had heard Quch a favourable char^tcter
from his mamma. In Mary Ann there was a certain affected
simper, and a craving for notice, that I was soiry to observe.
But her brother claimed all my attention to himself ; he
stood bolt upright between me and the fire, with his hands
behind his back, talking away like an orator, occasionally
interrupting his discourse with a sharp reproof to his sisters
when they made too much noise,
'Oh, Tom, what a darling you are !'eiclalmed his mother.
* Coma and kiss dear mamma : and then won't you show
Miss Grey your schoolroom, and your nice new books?'
'I won't kisB yon-t mamma ; but I will show Miss Grey
mj schoolroom, and my new books/
'And my schoolroom, and my new books, Tom/ said
Mary Ann,'They're mine too/

372
AGNES GREY
'They're mtn^/ replied he decisively.'Come along, Mias
Grey — FU eacorfc you/
When the room and books ha3 been ahown, with some
bickeiings between the brother B.nd si & ter that I did my
utmost to appease or mitigate. Mary Ann brought me her
doll, and began to be very loquacious on the Bubjeot of its
fine clothes, its bed, its chest of drawers, and other appur-
tenances ; but Tom told her to hold her clamourj that Mias
Grey might see his rocking-horse, whicb^ with a most im-
portant bustle, he dragged forth from its comer into the
middle oC the room, londly calling on me to attend to it.
Then, ordenDg his siater to hold the reins, he mounted, and
made me stand for ten minuteB, watching how manfully be
used his whip and spurs. Meantime, however, I adinired
Mary Ann's pretty doll, and all its possessions ; and then
told Master Tom he was a capital rider, but I hoped he
would not us© his whip and spurs bo much whsQ he rode a
real pony.
* Oh, yes, I will ! * said he, laying on with redoubled ardour.
* I'll cut into him like smoke 1 Eeh t my word I but he shall
sweat for it.'
This was very shocking ; but I hoped in time to be able
to work a reformation.
'Now you must put on your bonnet and shawl/ said the
little hero, * and I'll show you my garden/
'And mifie,'said Mary Ann.
Tom lifted his fist vdth a menacing gesture ; she utterad
a loud, shrill aareaiDj ran to the other side of me, and made
a face at him,
* Surely, Tom, you would not strike your eister \ I hope
I shall never see you do that/
'You will sometimes : I'm obliged to do it now and then
to keep her in order/
'But it is not your business to keep her in order, you
know— that is for'

seetDs likely to rain ;^and yon know I Have had a long
drive.*
* No matter — youmjistcowB ; I ahaU allow of no excuses,'
replied the conaGquontial little gentleman. And, as it was
the first day of our acquaiDtance^ I thought I might aa well
indulge him. It was too cold for Mary Ann to venture, so
ehe Btayed with her mamma, to the great relief of her
brother, who liked to have me all to him & elf.
The garden waB a large one» and tastefully laid out ;
besides several splendid dahliaa, there were some other fine
flowers still in bloom : but my companion would not give
me time to examine them : I must go with him, across the
wet grass, to a remote sequestered comer, the most impor-
tant place in the grounds, because it contained his garden.
There were two round beds» stocked with a variety of plants.
In one there was a pretty little rose-tree* I paused to
admire its lovely blossoms.
* Oh, never mind that 1'said he, contemptuously.
'That's only Mary Ann's garden ; look, teib is mine.'
After I had observed every flower, and listened to a
disquisition on every plant, I waB permitted to depart ; but
first, with great pomp, he plucked a polyanthus and
presented it to me, as one conferring a prodigious favour. I
observed, on the grass about his garden, certain apparatus
of sticks and cord, and asked what they were,
* Traps for birds.'
'Why do you catch them ?'
* Fapa says they do harm/
'And what do you do with them when you catch
them?'
'Different things. Sometimes I give them to the cat;
sometimes I cut them in pieces with my penknife ; but the
sextp I mean to roast alive/
I * And why do you maan to do such a horrible thing ?'
* For two reasons : first, to see how long it will live — and
then, to see what iir wnll taste like/
But don't you know it ia extremely wicked to do such
374
AGNES GEEY
things ? Bemamber^ the birdB c & n feel sA well aa you; nnd
think, how would you like it yourself ?'
'Ohj that*s nothing 1 I'm not a bird, and I can't feel what
I do to them/
* But you will have to feel it some tiroej Tom : you have
heard where wicked people go to when they die ; and if you
don't leave off torturing innocent biida, remember^ yon will
have to go thet-ej and suffer just what you have made ihem
Buffer/
'Oh^ pooh ! 1 sha*n*t. Papa knows how I treat them, and
he never blames me for it : he says it is just what He used to
do when He was a boy. Last summer, he gave me a nest fall
of young sparrows, and he saw me pulling off their legs and
wingSf and heads^ and never said anything ; esc < jpt that
they were nasty things, and I must not let them soil my
trousers ; and Uncle Bobson waa there too, and he laaghedt
and said I was a fine boy/
'But what would your mamma say 7'
'Ob, she doesn't care 1 she says it's a pity to Mil the
pretty singing birds, but the naughty sparrows, and txno & t and
rats, I may do what I like with. So now, Miss Greyt yon
see it is not i^icked > *
* I still think it is, Tom ; and perhaps your papa and
mamma woxild think so too, if they thought much about it
However,'I internally added^'they may say what they

kind, aa long as I have power to prevent it/
He next took me across ihe lawn to see bis mole-traps,
and Ihen into ihe stack-yard to see his wea9el*traps ; one of
which, to hia g^t^eat joy, contained a dead weasel ; and iben
into tbd stebW to see, not the fine oarriage-bor & es, but a Uttk
rough ooll, which he informed me had been bred on purpose
tor him, and he was to ride it as soon as it was properly
fcniited. I tned to amuse the little fellow, and listened to
all hit ofaMter ta oomplaoeptljr afi I ooold ; for I thought if

his ways : but I looked In vain for that generous, noble
spirit bis mother talked of ; though I could b & q he wels not
without a certain degiae of quickBoas and penetration, when
he ohose to exert it.
When we re-entered the house it was ne & rly tea-time.
Master Tom told me that, as papa was from homej he and I
and Mary Ann were to ba»ve tea with mamma, for a treat ;
for, on such occasions, she always dined at lunoheoD-time
with them, instead of at six o'clock. Soon after tea, Mary
AzLD went to bed, but Tom favoured us with his company
and conversation till eight. After he wa» gone, Mrs.
Bloomfield further enlightened me on the subject of her
children's dispositions and oct^uirementsi and on what they
were to learn, and how they were to be managed^ and
cautioned me to mention their defects to no one but herself.
My mother had warned me before to mention them as tittle
as possible to her, for people did not like to be told of their
children's faults, and & o I concluded I was to keep silence on
them altogether. Abont half-past nine, Mrs. Bloomfield
invited me to partake of a frugal supper of cold meat and
bread. I was glad when that waa over, and she took her
bedroom candlestick and retired to rest ; for though I wished
to be pieced with her, her coropaay was extremely irksome
to me ; and I could not help feeling that she was cold, grave,
and forbidding— the very opposite of the kind, warm-hearted
Ltron my hopes had depicted her to be*
CHAPTER m
A FEW UOBE LESSONS
I BOSS next morning with a feeling of hopeful exhil & rftdoi^^
in Bpite of the disappointments already eiperieaced ; bat I
found the dressLitg of Mary Ann was no light mf^tter^ ae bar
abundant hair was to be smeared with pomade, plaited to
three long tails, and tied with bows of ribbon : a task my tin-
aociistomed fingers found great difficult}^ in performing. 8bfi
told me her nurse could do it in half tiie time, ftnd, by keep-
ing up a constant fidget of impatienoe^ contrived to render tm
still longer. When all was done, we went into the school*
room, where I met my ether pupil, and chatted with the two
till it was time to go down to breakfast. That me & l being
tson eluded, and & few civil words having been exchanged with
Mrs. Bloomfield, we repaired to the schoolroom again, and
commenced the business of the day, I found my pupils very
backward, indeed ; but Tom, though ftver & e to every species
of mental exertion, was not without abilities, ^ary Ann
oould scarcely read a word, and was so careless and
inattentive that I could hardly get on ^nth her at aU. How-
ever, by dint of great labour and patience. I managed to get
something done in the course of the mornings aad tbeii
aocompanied my young charge out Into the garden and
adjacent ground^, for a Uttle r^reation before dinner* There
we got along tolerably together, except that I found they had
'^no notion of going lAith vi£ ; I must go ^^itb thern^ wharevm'
they chose to lead me. I must run, walk, or stand, exactly
as it e^ted their fancy. This, I thought, was rerer & ing the
order of things ; and I found it doubly disagreeable, as oa

is as vfeU as subsequent occatiioBs, they seemed'to prefer
the dirtiest places and the most dismal occupations. But
there was no remedy ; eifcliBT I must follow thetn, or keep
entirely apart from them, and thus appear neglectful! of my
charge. To-day, they manifested a particular attachment to
fk well at the bottom of the lawn, where they persisted in
dabbling with sticks and pebbles for above half an hour. I
waa in constant fear that their mother would see them from
the window, and blame me for allowing them thus to draggle
their clothes and wet their feet and hands, instead of taking
exercise ; but no arguments, commands, or entreaties could
draw them away. If s}i & did not see them, some one else
did — a gentleman on horseback had entered the gate and
was proceeding up the road ; at the distance of a few paces
(rotn us he paused, and calling to the children in a waBpiah
penetrating tone, bade them'keep out of that water/'Misa
Grey,'said he,'(I suppose it is Mias Grey), I am surpn & ed
that you should allow them to dirty their clothes in that
manner! Don't you see how Mias Bloorafield has soiled her

and both of them without gloves ? Dear, dear I Let me

GO ftayingj be turned away, and continued his ride up to the
house. This was Mr, Bloomfield. I was surpiised that be
should nominate his children Master and Miss Bloomfield ;
and still more bo^ that he should speak so uncivilly to me,
their governess, and a perfect stranger to himself. Presently
the bell rang to summon us in. I dined with the children at
one, while he and his lady took their luncheon at the same
table. His conduct there did not gteatly raise him in my
eatimation. He was a man of ordinary stature — rather below
thAD above — and rather thin than stout, apparently between
thirty and forty years of age : he had a large mouth, pale,
dingy complexion, milky blue eyes, and hair the colour of a
hempen cord. There was a roast leg of mutton before him :
he helped Mrs. Bloorofieid, the children, and me, desiiing me
X > cut up the children's fueat ; then, after twisting about th^

378
AGNES GREY
mutton in rarioua directions, and eyeing it from diHeraot
points, he pronounced it not fit to be e & ten, odid called for
the cold beef.
* What la tho matter with the mutton, mj daKr 7'aBked
his mate.
'It i & quite overdone- Don't you taste, Mi's, Blootnfield,
that all the goodness is roasted out o! it? And can't 70a
see that all tha.t nice, red gravy ia completely dried away ?'
'Well, I think the beef ^lU suit you/
The beef waa set before him, and he began to oanre, \m\
with the most rueful expressions of discontent*
'What is the matter with the beef, Mr. Bloomfield 7 Tm
sure I thought it was very nice.'
'And so it toas very nioe. A nioer joint could not be :
hvi,% i% h quite spoiled/ replied he, dolefully.
* How so ? ■
* How so I Why, don't yoa see how it b cut? Dear-
dear ! it is quite shocking ['
'Thsy must have out it wrong in the kitchen, then, far
I'm sure I caiTed it quite properly here, yesterday/
'No doubt they cut it wrong in the kitchen— the aavages !
Dear — dear 1 Did ever any one see such a fine piece of beef so
completely ruined ? But remember that, in future, when a
decent dish leaves this table, they shall not touch it in tbe
kitchen. Remember thai, Mrs. Bloomfield I'
Notwithstanding the ruinous state of the beef^ the geatle*
man managed to cut himself some delicate slices, part dt
which he ate In silence. When he next spoke, it was, in «
less querulous tone, to ask what there was for dinner.
'Turkey and grouse/ was the concise reply*
'And what besides ?'
'Fish.*
* What kind of fish?'
•I don't know/
'You don't know 9'cried he, looking solemnly tip from
his plate, ao4 suspending his knife and fork in astooub "
ment
AGNES GREY
379
No. I told tbe cook to get soino fish — I did not par-
ticularize what/
'Well, tha,t beats everything ! A la^y professes to keep
hoaae» and doesn't even know what fish is for dinner !
professos to order fish, and doesn't specify what !'
'PerhapBj Mr. Bloomfield, you will order dinner yourself
in future.*
Nothing more was said ; and I was very glad to get out
of the room with my pupils * for I never felt so ashamed and
uncomfortable in my life for anything that was not my own
Unit.
In the aftemcx)n we applied to lessons again : then went
out again ; then had tea in the schoolroom ; then I dressed
Mary Ann for deaaert ; and when she and her brother had
gone down to the dining-room, I took the opportunity of
beginning a letter to my dear friends at home : hut th^
children came up before I had half completed it. At seven
I had to put Mary Ann to bed ; then I played with Tom till
eight, when he, too, went ; and I finished my letter and
urtpacked my clothea, which I had hitherto found no oppor-
tunity for doing, and^ finally, went to bed myaelf.
But this is a very favourable specimen of a day's pro-
ceedings.
My task of instruction and eurveillance, instead of be-
coming easier as my charges and I got better accustomed to
each other, became more arduous as their characters unfolded.
The name of governess, I soon found, was a mere mockery
B£ applied to me : my pupils had no more notion of obedience
than a wild, unbroken colt. The habitual fear of their
father's peevish temper, and the dread of the punishments
he was wont to inflict when irritated, kept them generally
■within bounds in his immediate presence. The girls, too,
had some fear of their mother^a anger ; and the boy might
occasionally he bribed to do as she bid him by the hope of
reward ; but I had no rewards to offer ; and as for puniah-
roents, I was given to understand, the parents reserved that
privilege to themselves ; and yet they expected me to keep

980
AGNES OBEY
my pupils in order. Other children might be ^dod by the
fear of anger and the desire of approbation ; but neither ihe
one nor the other had any effect upon these.
Master Tom, not content with refusing to be ruled, mnsk
needs sBt up ba & ruler, ajid m & nifested a detemolnatioii to
keep, not only his sisters, but his governess in order, by
violent manuo,] and pedal applications ; and, as be was atftU,
strong boy of his years, this occasioned no trifling incoc*
vemence. A few sound boxes on the ear, on Gucb occasions,
might have settled the matter easily enough ; but a & ^ in xhnx
case, he might make up some story to his mother which sh$
would be sure to believe, as she had such unshaken faith in
his veracity — though I hod already discovered it to be by no
means unimpeachable — I determined to refrain from stri3dii|
him, even in self-defence ; and, in his most violent moods, roy
only resource was to throw him on his back and hold his
hands and feet till the frenzy was somewhat abated. To
the difficulty of preventing him from doing what he ought
not, was added that of forcing him to do what he ought
Often be would positively refuse to team, or to repe«(
his lessons, or even to look at his book. Here, again, ft
good birch i^d might have been serviceable; but, as my
powers were bo limited, I must make the best use of wbai
I had.
As there were no settled hours for study and play, I
resolved to give my pupils a certain task, which^ with moderate
attention, they could perform in a short time ; and till this
was done^ however weary I waa, or however perverse they
might be > nothing short of parental interference should indnc6
me to suffer them to leave the schoob-oom, even if I should
sit with my chair agfiinst the door to keep them in. Patience,
Firmness, and Perseverance were my only weapons ; ^
these I resolved to use to the utmost. I determined & lwbyi
strictly to fulfil the threats and promises I made ; and, to thk*
end, I must be cautious to thren.t«D and promise nothing thai
I could not perform. Then, I would carefully refrain frona iJl
useless irritability and indulgence of my own iU-tempff :
AGNES GREY
ddi
wlien they behaved tolerably, I wDuld be as kind and obliging
as itwas in my power to be, in order to miuke the widest poBsibla
difitinction between good and bEkd conduct ; I would reason
with thetn, too, in the simplest and most efTective manner.
When I reproved them, or refuBod to gratify their wishes,
after a glaring fault, it should be more in sorrow than in
anger : their little hymna and prayers I would make plain
and clear to their understanding ; when they said their
prayers at night and asked pardon for their offences, I would
remind Lhem of the sins of the past day, solemnly, hut in
perfect kindness, to avoid raising a spirit of opposition ;
penitential hymna should be Sfiid by the naughty, cheerful
ones by the comparatively good ; and every kind of instruc-
tion I would convey to them, as much as possible^ by enter-
taining discourse — apparently with no other object than their
present amusement in view.
By these means I hoped in time both to benefit the children
and to gain the approbation of their parents ; and also to con-
vince my friends at hoioe that I was not so wanting in skill and
prudence as they supposed. I knew the difficulties I had to
contend with were great ; but I knew (at least I believed)
tmremittiiig patience and perseverance could overcome them;
and night and morning I implored Divine assistfince to this
end. But either the children were so incorrigible, the parents
BO unreasonable, or myself so mistaken in my views, or so
unable to carry them out, that my best intentions and moat
Btrenuous efforts seemed productive of no better result than
sport to the children, dissatisfaction to their parents, Etnd
torment to myself.
The task of instruction was as arduous for the body as
the mind. I had to run after my pupils to catch them, to
carry or drag them to the tablei and often forcibly to hold
them there till the le & Bon was done. Tom I frequently put
into a corner, seating myself before him in a chair, with a
book which contained the little task that must be said or
readf before ho was released, in my hand. He was not strong
enough to push both me and the chair away, bo he would
383
AGNES GEEY
etancl twisting hia body and face into the most grotesque Mid
aingular contortions — laiighftble» nodoubt» to an unconcerned
spectEktor^ but not t-o me— and uttering loud yella and doleful
outcries, intended to represent weeping but wholly withooi
the accompaniment of tears. I knew this was done solely
for the purpose of annoying me ; and, therefore, however I
might inwardly tremble with impatience and irritation, I
manfully strove to suppnesa all visible signs of molestatiooi
and affected to sit with calm indiOerence^ waiting till it fihould
please him bo ceaBe this paBtime, and prepare for a run m
the garden^ by casting his eye on the book and reading or
repeating the few words he was required to say. Sometimei
he was determined to do his writing badly ; and I bad to
hold his hand to prevent him from purposely blotting of
disfiguring the paper. Frequently I threatened that, if he did
not do better, he should have another Une : then he wouW
Btubbornly refuse to write this line ; and I, to save my word,
bad finally to resort to the expedient of holding his fingen
upon the pen, and forcibly drawing his hand np and down,
till, in spite of big resistance, the line was in some sort com-
pleted.
Yet Tom was by no means the most unmanageable of m J
pupils : sometimes, to my great joy, he would have the sense
to see that his wisest policy was to finish his tasks, and go
out and amuse himself till I and hia sisters came to join lum;
which frequently waa not at all, for Mary Ann seldom
followed his example in this particular : she apparently pre-
ferred rolling on the floor to any other amusement : down
she would drop like a leaden weight ; and when I, withgrsaS
diffictilty, had succeeded in rooting her thence, I had stiU to
hold her up with one arm, while with the other I held the
book from which she was to read or spell her lesson. As the
dead weight of the big girl of sis became too heavy for one
arm to bear, I transferred it to the other ; or, if both wen
weary of the burden, I carried her into a comer, and toldhtf
she might come out when she should find the US6 of herfeei
and stand up : but she generally preferred lying there Uke a
AGNES GREY
< g till dinner or teatime, when^ a.3 I could not depriva her of
her meals, she must be liberated, and would come crawling
out with a grin of triumph on her round, red ftuse. Often she
would stubbornly refuse to pronounce some particular word
in her lesson ■ and now I regret the lost labour I have had
in striving to conquer her obstinacy. If I bad passed it over
OS a matter of no consequence, it would have been better for
both parties, than vainly striving to oyercome it as I did ;
but I thought it my absottite duty to ciiish this vicious teu <
dency in the bud : and so it was, if I could have done it ; and
had my powers been less limited^ I might have enforced
obedience ; but, as it wus» it was a trial of strength between
her and me» in which she generally came off %ictonous ; and
every victory served to encourage and strengthen her for a
future contest. In vain I argued, coaxed, entreated, threat-
ened, scoldtid ; io vain I kept her in from play, or, if obliged
to talce her out, refused to play with tier, or to speak kindly
or have anything to do with her ; in vain I tried to set before
ber the advantages of doing as she was bid, and being loved,
and kindly treated in consequence, and the disadvantages of
perBisting in her absurd pervBi & ity. Sometimes, when she
would ask me to do something for her, I would answer, —
* Yes, I will, Mary Ann, if you will only say that word.
Come I you'd better say it at oncei and have no more trouble
about it/
• No/
'Then, of course, I can do nothing for you/
With me, at her age, or under, neglect and disgrace were
the most dreadful of punishments ; but on her they made no
impression. Sometimes, exasperated to the utmost pitcV, I
would shake her violently by the shoulder, or pull her long
hmr, cr put her in the corner ; for which she punished nia
with loud, shrill, piercing screams^ that went through my
head like a knife. She knew I hated this, and when she had
shrieked her utmost, would look into my face with an air of
vindictive satisfaction, exclaiming, — * Now, then I that's for
youl'and then shiiek again and again^ till I was forced to
884
AGNES GREY

stop my ears. Often theee dreadful cries would bring Mrs.
Bloomfield up to iDquire what was the matter?
'Mary Ann is a naughty girl^ ma'am/
'But what are these shocking screams ?'
'She la screaming in a passion/
'I never heard such a dreadful noise t You might ht
killing hen Why is she not out with her brother?'
'I cEinnot get her io iinish her lessons/
'But Mary Ann must be a good girl, and finish her
lesaons/ This was blandly spoken to the child.'And I
hope I shall never hear such tennble cries again 1'
And fixing her cold, stony eyea upon me with a look that
could not be mi & ta-ken, she would shut the door, and w»Ik
away. Bometimes I would try to take the little obstinate
creature by surprisej and casually ask her the word while
she was thinking of something else ; frequently she would
begin to say it, and then suddenly check herself, with a pro-
voking look that seemed to say,'Ah I I'm too sharp for you;
you fihan't trick it out of me, either/
On another occasion, I pretended to forget the wbob
affair ; and talked and played wifch her as usual, till night,
when I put her to bed ; then bending over her, while she Lvjf
all smiles and good humour, just before departing, I said, ad
cheerfully and kindly as before — * Now, Mary Atm, just tell
me that word before I kiss you good-night. You are a good
girl now, and» of course, you will say it/
'No, I won*t/
* Then I can't kis8 yoil.'
* Well, I don't care/
In vain I expressed my sorrow ; in vain I lingered for
Bome symptom of contrition ; she really'didn't care/ aud I
left her alone» and in darkness, wondering most of all al l^is
last proof of insensate stubbornness. In my childbooel I
ooutd not imagine a more afllictLve punishment than for my
mother to refuse to kiss me at night: the very idea was
terrible. More Ihan the idea I never felt, for, happily, I
pevor committed a fault that was deemed worthy of such i

AGNES GREY
985
lalty; but once I remerDber, for some traQBgreBaion of my
i6ter*6, our mother thought proper to inflict it upon her:
she felt, I cannot tell ; but my aympathetio tears and
faring for her sake I shall not soon forget*
Another troublesome trait in Majy Ann'was her incor-
Igible propensity to keep running into the nursery^ to play
Ith her little sisters and the ntLree. This wag nattinJ.
lough, but, as it was against her mother's express desire, I,
oourge, forbade her to do fio, and did my utmost to keep
sr with me ; but that only increased her relish for the
mraery, and the rtiore I strove to keep her out of it, the
Etener she went, and the longer she stayed, to the great
laatisfaotion of Mrs. Bloomfield^ who, 1 well knew, would
ipute all the blame of the matter to me. Another of my
ials was the dressing in the morning : at one time she
not be washed [ at another she would not be dressed,
less she might wear some particular frocks that I knew
ir mother would not like her to have ; at another she would
D and run away if I attempted to touch her hair. So
it, frequently^ when, after much trouble and toil, I had,
length, succeeded in bringing her down, the breakfast
nearly half over ; and black Looks from'mamma/ and
ity observations from'papa,'spoken at me, if not to
le, were sure to be my meed : for few things irritated tha
ktter so much as want of punctuality at meal times, Then,
long the minor annoyances, was my inability to satisfy
Bloomficld with her daughter's dress ; and the child's
'was never fit to be seen/ Sometimes, ae a powerful
sproaoh to me, she would perform the office of tire woman
jrself, and then complain bitterly of the trouble it gave her.
When little Fanny came into the schoolroom, I hoped
10 would be mild and inoffensive, at least ; but a few days,
not a few hours, sufficed to destroy the illusion : I found
a mischievous, intractable little creature, given up to
)hood and deception, young as she was, and alarmingly
of exercising her two favourite weapons of offence and
»feoce : thai pf spitting in the faces of thosq who incurred
986
AGNES GREY

her displeasure, and ballowiDg like a bull'when her tint^
SDnable desires were not gratified. A a she, genenillyt wad
pretty quiet in her parents'preaeuce, and they were impreeaed
with the notion of her being a remarkably gentle child, bet
falaehoods were readily believed, and her loud upronj^ le^
them to suspect harsh and injudicious treatment on my p*rt;
and when, at length, her bad disposition becaitue manifest
even to their prejudiced eyes, I felt that the whole was
attributed to me.
'What a nnughty girl Funny is getting I * Mrs. Bloomfield
would say to her spouse. * Don't you obser\'e» my detf.
how she is altered Bince she entered the sohoolroom ? She
will soon be as bad as the other two ; and, I am sorry to My,
they have quite deteriorated of late/
* You may say that,'was the answer, • I've been think-
ing that same myself. I thought when we got them *
governess they'd improve ; but, instead of that, they get
worse and worse : I don't know how it is with their learning,
but their habits, I know, make no aort of improvement ; they
get rougher, and dirtier, and more unseemly every day.'
I knew this waa all pointed at me ; and these, and iD
aimilar innuendoes, aGTecied me far more deeply than any
open accusations would have done ; for against the latter 1
should have been roused to speak in my on^'u defence : now
I judged it my wisest plan to subdue every resentful
impuIsGi suppress every sensitive shrinking, and go oo
perseveringly, doing my best ; for, irksome as my situation
was, I earnestly wished to retain it. I thought, if I oodU
Struggle on with unremitting firmness and integrity, th«
children would in time become more humanized : eTery
month would contribute to make them some little wiser.
and, consequently, more manageable ; for a child of nine or
ten as frantic and ungovernable as these at & ix and o & vtn
would be a maniac.
I flattered myself I was benefiting n^y parents and dster
by my continuance here ; for small as the salary was, I still
was earning something, and with strict economy I could ea & iJ]
AGNES GREY
387
manage to have something to spare for them, if they would
favour me by taking it* Then it was by my own will that I
had got tho place : I had brought all this tribulation on
myself, and I was determined to bear it ; nay, more than
that, I did not even regret the step 1 had taken, I longed to
show my friends that, even now, I was competent to under-
take the charge, and able to acquit myself honourably to the
end ; and if ever I felt it degrading to submit so quietly, or
intolerable to toil so constantly^ I would turn towards my
home, and aay within myself —
They mr^y cmsh, bttt they sbill not Aubdue me t
^Tis ol thca lb»t 1 thtak, oQt of them.
About Christmas I was allowed to visit home ; but my
holiday was only of a fortnight's duration :'For, " said Mrs.
Bloom6eld^ * I thought, as you had seen your friends so
lately, you would not care for a longer stay/ I left her to
think so atill : but she littlo knew how long, how wearisome
those fourteen weeks of absence bad been to me ; how
intensely I had longed for my holidays, how greatly I waa
disappointed at their curtailment. Yet she was not to blame
in this ; I had never told her my feelings, and she could not
be eatpected to divine them ; I had not been with her a full
term, and she was justified in not allowing me a full
vacation.
CHAPTER IV
THE GBAlfDHAHUA
I SPARE! my rea4era the account of my delight on coming
home, my hiippiness ■while there — enjoying a brief space ol
TQsi and Liberty in that dear, familiar place, among the loving
and the loved — and my sorrow on being obliged to bid theia,
eccG more, a long adiau.
I returned^ however, with unabated vigoiir to my work—
a more arduoua task than anyone can imagine, who has nol
felt EometMng like the roisery of being charged with tbec & i«
and direction of a set of mi & chievous, turbulent rebeU, whom
his utmost exertions cannnt bind to their duty ; while, & t the
3Q.ine timci he is responsible far their conduct to a hi^ier
power, who exacts from him what cannot be achieved with*
out the aid of the superior's more potent authority ; which,
either from indolenoe^ or the fear of becoming onpopoliT
with the said rebeliious gang, the latter refuses to givs- 1
can conceive few situations more harassing than th & t whfireiBi
however you may long for succ^s, however you may kbonr
to fulfil yoTir duty, your efforts are baflfled and set at nought
by those beneath you, and unjustly censured and misjudgd
by those above.
I have not enumerated half the vexatious propeusjtids of
my pupils, or half the troubles resulting from tny heavy r^
Bponsibilitiea, for fear of trespassing too much upon thereader'i
patience ; as, perhaps, I have already done ; but my dedgD
in writing the few lOfSt pages was not to amuse, but to benefii
those whom it might ootic^n ; he that has no interest b su^

matters will doubtloas have skippod thom over with & oursory
gtanco, and, porhaps, d, malGdiGtion Opgainst the prolixity o£ tha
writer ; but if & pai'ent has, therefrooa] gathered any useful
hint, or an unfortunate governess received thereby the
slightest benefit, I am -well rewarded for tny pains.
To avoid trouble and confusion, I have taken my pupils
one by one, and discussed their various qualities ; but this
can give no adequate idea of being worried by the whole three
together ; when, aa was often the case* all were determined
to'be naughty, and to bease Miss Grey, and put her in a
passion/
Sometimes, on such oceasions, the thought has suddenly
occurred to me —'If i^iey could see me now I'meaning, of
course, my friends at home ; aod the idea of how they would
pity me has made me pity myself — so greatly that I have
had the utmost difficulty to restrain my tears : but I have
restrained them, till my little tormentors were gone to
dessert, or cleared o£F to bed (my only prospects of deliver*
ance), and then, in all the bliss of solitude, I have given
niyself up to the luxury of an unrestricted burst of weeping.
But this was a weakness I did not often indulge : my em-
ployments were too numerous, my leisure moments too
precious, to admit of much time being given to fruitless
lamentations.
I particularly remember one wild, sno\s'y afternoon, soon
after my return in January ; the children had all come up (mm
dinner, loudly declaring that they meant'to be naughty ; *
and they had well kept their resolution, though I had talked
myself hoaise, and wearied every muscle in my throat, in
the vain attempt to reason them out of it. 1 bad got Tom
pinned up in a corner, whence, I told him, he should not
escape till he had done hia appointed task. Meantime,
Fanny had possessed herself of my work-bag, and was rifling
its contents^ — and spitting into it besides. I told her to let
it alone^ but to no purpose, of course.'Bum iti Fanny I'
cried Tom ; and this command she hastened to obey. I
sprang to snatch it from the fire, and Tom darted to the door.

'Mary Ann, throw lier desk oat of the window ! * cried be:
Gind my pr^ious desk, contaiaing my letters and papers, us;
& mall amount of cash, and all my valuables, was aixiut to b«
precipitated from the three-storey window, I flew to resc^
)t. Meanwhile Tom hod loft the room, and was rushlDg
down the stairs, followed by Fanny, Having secnred my
desk, I rnn to catch them, and Mary Ann came & o & mpensg
after. All three escaped me, and ran out of the bonse into
the garden, where they plunged about in the saow, shouting
and Bcreaming in exultant glee.
What must I do ? If I followed them, I should probably
bo unable to capture one, and only drive them farther away ,
if I did not, how was I to get them in ? And what woiil^
their parents ihink of me, if they saw or heard the children
rioting, hatloss, bonnetleas, glovelese, and bootless^ in the deep
soft snow? While I stood in this perplei & ity, just wilhout
the door, trying, by grim looks and angry words, to aw© them
into Bubjection, I heard a voice behind me, in harshly piercing
tones, exclaiming, —
'Mis€ Grey ! Is it possible ? What, in the devil's nam^
can you he thinking about? *
'I can't get them in, sir/ said I, turning round, and
beholding Mr. Bloomtield, with his hair on end^ and his pale
blue eyes bolting from their sockets.
'But I INSIST upon their being got in 1'cried he, approach*
ing nearer, and looking perfectly ferocious.
'Then, sir, you must call them yourself, if you pleue,
for they won't listen to me,'I replied, stepping back.
'Come in with you, you filthy brats ; or I'll horsd'wyp
you every one !'roared he ; and the children instantly
obeyed. * There, you see I they come at the first word ('
* Yes, when you speak,'
'And iVa very strange, that when youVe the care of'em
youVe no better control over'em than that t — Now, thert
they are — gone up-stairs with their nasty snowy feel t Do

That gentileman's mother wa.B then atfiying in the bouse ;
and, as I ascended the stairs and piissed the drawing-room
door, I had the satisfaction of hearing the old lady declaiming
aloud to her daughter-in-law to this eSeot (for I could only
distiinguish the most emphatic words) —
'Gracious heavens t never in all my life— — ! get
their death as sure as — — ! Do you think, my dear^ she's
Ik proper person 7 Take my word (or it*^ — ^'
I heard no more ; but that sufficed.
The senior Mrs. Blaomfield had been very attentive and
civil to me ; and till now I had thought her a nice, kind-
hearted, chatty old body. She would often come to me and
ialk in a coniidential strain ; nodding and shaking her head,
and gesticulating with hands and eyes, as a certain clasB of
old ladies are won't to do ; though I never knew one that
carried the peculiarity tc ao great an extent. She would even
sympathise with me for the trouble I had with the children,
and express at times, by half sentenceSp interspersed with
nods and knowiag winks, her sense of the injudicious conduct
of their mamma in so restricting my power^ and neglecting
to support me with her authority. Such a mods of testifying
disapprobation was not much to my taste ; and I generally
refused to take it m» or understand anything more than was
openly spoken ; at least, I never went farther than an implied
acknowledgment that, if matters were othenvise ordered my
task would he a less difficult one, and 1 should be better able
to guide and instruct my charge ; but now I must be doubly
cautious. Hitherto, though 1 saw the old lady had her de-
fects (of which one was a proneness toproclaimherpei'fectiona),
I had always been wishful to escuse them, and to give her
credit for all the virtues she professed, and even imagine
others yet untold. Kindness, which had been the food of
my life through so many years^ hfid lately been so entirely
denied me, that I welcomed with grateful joy the slightest
semblance of it. No wonder, then, that my heart warmed
bo the old lady, and always gladdened at her approaoh and
etted her departure.

But now, the few words luckily or unluckity heard m
passing had wholly revolutioaized my ideaa respecltng her i
now I looked upon her as hypocritical and insinoere, ft
flatterer, and a Bpy upon my words and dedd3, Douhtlsea
it would have been my interest still to meet her with the
same cheerful smile and tone of respectful cordiality as
before; but I could not, if I would: my m & nner altered
with my feelings, and became so cold and shy that she could
not fail to notioe it. She soon did notice it, and h^r manner
altered too : the familiar nod was changed to a stiff bow, the
gracious smile gave place to a glare of Gorgon ferocity ; her
vivacious loquacity was entirely transferred from ine to'the
darling boy and girU,* whom she flattered and indulgod
more absurdly than ever their mother had done, ^|
I confess I was somewhat troubled at this change : ^^
feared the con & equencea of her displeasure, and even made
Bome efforts to recover the ground I had lost — and with
better apparent success than I could have anticipated. At
one time, I, merely in common civility, asked after het
cough ; immediately her long visage related into a smile,
and she favoured me with a particular history of that and
her other infirmitiesi followed by an account of her pious
resignation, delivered in the usual emphatic, dedam & to:
style, which no writing can portray.
'But there's one remedy for all, my dear, and tha'
resignation * (a toss of the head),'resignation to the will of
heaven I'(an uplifting of the hands and eyes)^'It hu
always supported roe through all my trials, and always wiH
do ■ (a succession of nods).'But then, it isn't everybody
that can say that'(a shake of the head) ;'but I'm one d
the pious ones, Miss Grey ['(a very significant nod and toss)-
'And^ thank heaven, I always was'(another nod), * and I
glory in it !'(an emphatic claaping of the hand^ and shakiag
of the head). And with several texts of Scripture, ini»-
quoted or misapplied, and religious exclamations so redolsBl
of the ludicrous in the style of delivery and manner of
bringing in, if not in the expressions themselves, tfa & t I

Bclme repeating them, she withdrew; tossing her large
aad in high good^hiimour— with herself a^t least — and
lii me hoping that, after all. ghe " waa rather weaJt tbiui
icked.
At her next visit to Wellwood House, I went ao far aB to
ly I was glad to & ee her looking so well. The effect of
lis was magical : the words, intended as a mark of civility^
rero received as a flattering compliment ; her countenance
rightened up, and from that moment & he became aa
racious and benign as heart could wish — in outward
smblance at least. From what I now saw of her, and
rhat I heard from the children^ I knew that^ in order to gain
er cordial fneDdislnp, I had but to utter a word of flattery
t each convenient opportunity : but this was against my
iTDcipleB ; and for lack of this, the capricious old dame
oon deprived me of her favour again, and I believe did ma
luch secret injury.
She could not greatly influence her daughter-in-law
gainst me, (because, between that lady and herself thero
ras a mutual disltke^-chiefly shown by her in secret de-
raotions and calumniations ; by the other, in an excess of
igid formality in her demeanour ; and no fav^Tiing flattery
f the elder could thaw away the wall of ice which the
ounger interposed between them. But with her son, the
Id I*dy had better success : he would listen to all she had
) aay, provided she could soothe his fretful temper^ and re-
■ain from irritating him by her own asperities ; and I have
^ason to believe that she considerably strengthened hia
rejudice against me. Bhe would tell him that I shamefully
^glected the chlldreup and even his wife did not attend to
lem as she ought ; and that he must look after them him-
tlfp or they would all go to ruin.
Thus urged, he would frequently give himself the trouble
watching them from the vrindowa during their play ; at
oaea, he would follow them through the grounds, and too

he would unexpectedly pop hia head into the schoclitxHU
while the young people were at rooala, and find them spilling
thoir milk over the ta.ble and themselves, plunging their
fingers into their cwn or each other^s tnuga, or quarreUing
over their victuals hke a set of tiger's ouba. If 1 wei'e quial
at tho mometit, I was conniving at their disorderly oondoct;
if (as was frequently the case) I happened to be exalting my
voice to enforce order, I was using undue violence, aod
Betting the girls a bad example by Buch ungentleaesa of tone
and liunguage.
I romember one aftontoon in spring when, owing to the
rain, they could not go out ; hut, by some amazing gooA
fortune, they had all finished their lessong, and yet absUundd
from running down to tease their parents — ft trick (hit
annoyed me greatly, hut whichj on rainy days, I seldom
could prevent their doing ; because, below, they found
novelty and amusement — especially when visibore were io
the house ; Etnd their mother, though she htd me keep them
in the schoolroom, would never chide them for leaving it, or
iroubk herself to send them back. But tbia day Ibaf
appeared satisfied %\^th their present abode, and whttt t«
more wonderful still, seemed disposed to play togetbdr
without depending on me for amusement, and wilhool
quan'elling with each other. Their occupation wae a taob'
whiLt puzzling one : they were all squatted together oo tfctf
floor by the windoWj over a heap of broken toys aod ft
quantity of birds* eggs — or rather egg-shella, (or the oontenfai
had luckily been abstracted. These sheila they hod brolsen
up and were pounding into small fragmentSt to what end I
ODuId not imagine ; but so long as they warn quiet mkI bU

And when the matter was explained to her, all ghe did was

CHAPTEB V
THS IJSCLS
Bbbides the old lady^ there was another relAtive of
family, whose visits were a gre & t armoy & nc^ to me — this vm
'Uncle Robaon/ Mrs. 61oomfield*9 brother ; a tall, selT-
Bufficient fellow^ with dark ha.ir and sallow oomplexion lilte
his aiater, a nose that seemed to diadain the earth, and littt^
grey eyes, frequently haH-closed^ with a nojxttii^ of re & l
gtupidtty and aSected contempt of all suiroaoding objects.
He was a thick-set, strongly-built man, hut he had found
fiome means of compressing his w^ist into a remarkably
Bmall compass ; and that, together with the minatural stiff-
ness of his form, showed that the lofty-minded, maiily lilr,
Bobson, the scornor of the female sex, was not above the
foppery of stays. He seldom deigned to notice me ; and,
when he did, it was with a cerUin aupercilioua iDsoleaoe ot
tone and manner that convinced me he was no genUemaD :
though it was intended to have a contrary effect. But it
was not for that I disliked his coming, so much as for the
harm he did the cbildi-en — encouragiog all their evil pro-
pensities, and undoing in a few minutes the little good it
had taken ma months of labour to achieve.
Fanny and little Harriet he seldom condescended to
notice ; but Mary Ann was something of a favourite. H«
was coDiinually encouraging her tendency to Affectatioo
(which 1 hod dons my utmost to crush], talking about her
pretty face, and filling her head with all manner of conoeited
notions concerning her peTBOnal appearance (which I bid
AGNES GBEY

instructed bar to rpgard aa dust in the balfmce oampEurod
with the cultivation of her mind and manners) ; ajid I nev«r
saw a child bo Busoeptihle of flattery as she was. Whatever
waa wrong, in either her or her brother, ho would encourage
by laughing at^ if not by actually praising : people Ilttile know
the injury they do to children by laughing at their fEmlfcs,
and making a pleaBant jest of what their true friends
have endeavoured to tetich them to hold in grave abhorrence.
Though not a positive drunkard, Mr. Robaon habitually
swallowed great quantities of wine, and took with relish an
ocoasional glass of brandy and water. He baugbt his
nephew to imitate him in tHs to the utmost of his ability,
and to believe that the more wine and spb-ita he could take»
and the better he liked them, the more he nianifeated his bold
and manly spirit, and rose superior to his sisters. Mr.
Bloomfield bad not much to say against it, for his favourite
beverage was gin and water ; of which he took a considerable
portion every day, by dint of constant sipping— and to that
I chiefly attributed his dingy oomplexion and waspish
temper.
Mr, Robson likewise encouraged Tom's propensity to
persecute the lower creation, both by precept and example,
Aa he frequently came to course or shoot over bis brother-in-
law's grounds, ho would bring his favourite dogs with him ;
ftod he treated them so brutally that» poor as I waSj I would
have given a sovereign any day to see one of them bite him,
provided the animal could have done it > vith impunity.
Sometimea, when in a very complacent mood, he would go
a-birds'-nesting with the children : a thing that irritated and
annoyed me exceedingly; as, by frequent and persevering
attempts, I flattered myself I had partly shown them the evil
of this pastime, and hoped, in time, to bring them to some
general sense of juBtice and humanity; but ten minutes*
birds'-neating with uncle Bobson, or even a laugh from him
at some relation of their former barbarities, was sufilcient at
cnce to destroy the effect of my whole elaborate course of
leasonhig and persuasion. Happily, however, during that
400
AGNES GREY
spring, tney never^ but once, got anything but empty nests,
or eggs — being too impatient tw leave them till the birds wer*
hatched ; that once» Tom, who h^ been with his uncle into
the neighbooirtDg pkntatiooj came running in high glee into
the gardBDr with a brood of little callow aestlings in his
h & ndB. Mary Aon and Fanny, whom I was just bringiTig
out, ran to admire his spoils, and to beg each a bird for them-
eelves,'No > not one 1'cried Tom,'TheyVe oil mine;
uncle Robson gave them to me — one, fcwo, three, four, five-
you shan't touch one of them ! no, not one, for your liyes ('
continued he, e^tultingly ; laying the n^t on the ground, and
standing over it with his legs wide apart, hia hands thras!
into Ms breeches-pockets, his body bent forward, and his hce
twisted into all manner of contortions in the ecstasy of hi^
delight.
'■ But you shall aee me fettle'eoi off. My word, but I
toi7/ wallop'em ? See if I don't now. By gum! btit there's
rare sport for me in that neat/
'But« Tom/ said I,'I shall not allow yon to torture tboGs
birds. They must either be killed at once or carried back lo
the place yon took them from, that the old birds may continue
to feed them/
'But you don't know where that is. Madam : it's only me
and uncle Bobson that knows that/
'But if you don't tell me, I shall kill them myself— mud
as I hate it/
'You daren't. You daren't touch them for your life!
because you know papa and mammae and uncle HobsoOt
would be angry. Ha, ha! I've caught you there, Misa!* |
'I shall do what I think right in a case of this sort with-
out consulting any one. If your papa and mamma don't
happen to approve of it, I shall be sorry to offend them ; ha\
your uncle Bobson's opinions, of course, are nothing to me/
So saying— urged by a Bense of duty — at the ri^ of both
making myself siek and incurring the wrath of my employers
'— I got a large flat stone, that bad been reared up for a
mouse-trap by the gardener; then, having onoe more tdiolj
AGNE8 GKEY

endeavoured to persuade the tittle tyrant to let the birds
be carried back, I asked what he intendod to do with ihem.
With fiendish glee he commenced a list of torments ; and
while he was busied in the relation, I dropped the stone upon
his intended victims and crushed them flat beneath it. Loud
wers the outcries, terrible the execrations, consequent upon
this daring outrage ; uncle Robson had been coming up the
walk with his gun, and was just then pausing to kick his dog.
Tom flew towards him^ vowing he would make him kick nie
instead of Juno. Mr, Robson leant upon his gun, and
laughed excessively at the violence of his nephew's passion,
and the bitter maledictions and opprobrious epithets he
heaped upon me.'Well, you are a good'un !'exclaimed
hOp at length, taking up his weapon and proceeding towards
the house. Damme, but the lad has some spunk in him, too.
Curse me* il ever I saw a nobler little scoundrel than that.
He's beyond petticoat government already : by God I ho
defies mother, gru,nny, governess, and all t Ha, ha, ha I
Kever mind, Tom, 111 get you another brood to-morrow.'
* If you do, Mr, Bobaon, I shall kill them too/ sEiid I.
'Humph I'replied he^ and having honoured me with a
broad stare — which, contrary to his expectations, I sustained
without flinching— he turned away with an air of supreme
contempt, and stalked into the house. Tom next went to tell
his mamma. It was not her way to say much on any sub-
ject ; but, when she next saw me, her aspect and demeanour
were doubly dark and chilled. After some casual remark
about the weather, she observed — * I am sorry. Miss Grey,
you should think it necessary to interfere with Master Bloom-
field's amusements ; he was very much distressed about your
troying the birds.'
When Master Bloemfield's amusements consist in injur-
ing sentient creatures/ I answered, * I think it my duty to
interfere/
'You seemed to have forgotten/ said she, calmly, * that
the creatures were all created for our convenience/
I thought that doctrine admitted some doubt, but merel^f

I judged it prudent to say no more. This was tlv

ma to pravent it. But how could I — when the guests, with
their fine elothea and now facGBj continually flattered and
indulged them, out of oompltusance to their parents^how'\
oould /, with my homely garments, every-day fiiO©j and j^
honeftt words, draw them away ? I Btrained every nerve to
do 60 : by atrtving to amuse ihem^ I eodoavoured to attract
them to my side; by the exertion of such authority as I
pos & esaed, and by such seventy as I dared to uae, I Iried to
deter them from tormenting the gueatB ; and by repixiaohing
their unmannerly cooduot, to make them ashamed to repeat it.
But Ihey knew no shame ; they scorned authority which had
QO terrors to back it ; and as for kindness andaffeetion, either
they had no hearts, or such as they had were so strongly
guarded, and so well concealed, that I, with all my efforts,
had not yet diaoovered how to rea < ;h them,
But soon my trials in tins quarter oame to a close — sooner
ao I either expected ordesired ; for one sweet evening towards
he close of May, as I waa rejoicing in the near appi-oach o£
the holidays, and oongratulating myself upon having made
some progress w^th my pupils (as far as their learning went,
at least, for I had instilled something into their heads, and I
had, at length, brought them to he a Uttle — a very little —
more rational about getting their lessons done in time to
leave some spaoe for recreation, instead of tormenting them-
flelves and me all day long to no purpose), Mrs. Bloomfield
sent for me, and calmly told me that after Midsummer my
services would be no longer required. She assured me that
my character and general conduct were unexceptionable ; but
the children had made so Little improvement since my arrival
that Mr. Bloom & eld and tjhe felt it their duty to seeksome other
mode of instruction. Though superior to most children of their
years in abilities, they were decidedly behind them in attain^
ments ; their manaers were uncultivated, and their tempers
unruly. And this she attributed to a want of suMcient
firmness, and diligent, persevering care on my pait.
Unshaken firmness, devoted diligence, unwearied perse-
veraace, unceasing oaj'e, were the very qualifications on

404
AGNES GBBT
whioh I had secretly prided myself ; and by which I had
hoped in time to oTercome all difiicidtiefi, and obtain success
at laat. I wished to aa-y something in tny own justificadon ;
but in attempting to speak, I felt my voice falter; and
rather than testify any emotion, or suffer the teai^ to
overflow that were already gathering in my eyes, I chose to
keep silencCr and bear all like a self-convicted culprit.
Thus was I dismi^ed^ and thus I sought my home.
Alaa I what would they think of me ? tinablei after all my
boasting, to keep my place^ even for a single year, ba
governess to three small children, whose mother was asserted
by my own aunt to be a'very nice woman.'Having beeu
thus weighed in the balance and found wanting, I need not
hope they would be willing to try me again. And this was
an unwelcome thought ; for vexed, harassed^ disappointed aa
I had b & en, and greatly as I had learned to love and value
my home, I was not yet weary of adventure, nor willing to
relax my efforts. I knew that all parents were not like Mr.
and Mrs. Bloomfield, and I was certain all children were
not like theirs. The next family must be different, and any
change must be for the better. I had been seasoned by ad-
versity, and tutored by experience, and I longed to redeem
my lof^t honour in the eyes of those whose opinion was moie
than that of all the world Co me.

CHAPTER VI
TB£ FABSONAQS AOAlZf
FcB a few montha I remained peaceably at home, in the
quiet enjoyment of Liberty tind rest, and genuiiie friendship,
from all of which I had fasted so long ; and in the earnest
proseoution of my studies^ to recover ^hat I had lost during
my stay at Wellwood House, and to lay in new stores for
future use. My father's health was still very infirnij but not
materially worse than when I laslt saw him ; and I was glad
I had it in my power to cheer him by my return, and to
amuse him with ainging his favourite songs^
No one triumphed over my failure, or said I had better
have taken big or her advice, and quietly stayed at home.
All were glad to have me back again, and laviahed more
kinduasB than ever upon me, to make up for the sufifenngs I
bad undergone ; but not one would touch a shilling of what
I had BO cheerfully earned and so carefully saved, in the hope
of sharing it with them. By dint of pinching here, and
scraping there, our debts were already nearly paid, Mary bad
had good success with her drawings ; but our father had
insisted upon her likewise keeping all the produce of her
industry to herself. AH we could spare from the supply of
our humble wardrobe and our little casual expenses, he
directed us to put into the savings'-bank ; saying, we knew
not how soon we might be dependent on that alone for
support 1 for he felt he had not long to be with us, and what
would become of our mother and us when he was gone^ God
only knew I
Dear papa [ if he had troubled himself less about the

afflictions that threatened ua in c & se o£ hia deaths I am oofi*
vinoed that drecded event would not b & ve taken pl & ce & o »ooa.
My mother would never BuEFer him to ponder on the Babject
if she could help it.
'Oh» Richa.id 1 * exclaimed ehe, on one occasion, * \i yoa
would hut (lismias such gloonoy subjects from your mind,
you would live as long aa any of u* ; at least you would
live to see the girls married, and yourself a happy grandfathtJ,

My mother laughed, and so did my father : but his laugh
Boon peiished in a dreary aigh.
^They married — poor penaileaa things!* aaid he; *vrho
will take thena I wonder I'
'Why, nobody shall that isn't thankful for them.
Wasn't I penniless when you took me? and you pret^ndtd,
at least, to be vastly pleased with your acquisition. But it's
no matter whether tliey get married or not : we can devisa i
thousand honeat ways of making a livelihood. And I wonder,
Richard, you can think of bothering your head about our
poverty in case of your death ; as If tfiat would be anything
compared with the calamity of losing you — an affliction thivi
you well know would swallow up all othsrs, and which you
ought to do your utmost to preserve us from : and there is
nothing like a cbeedul mind for keeping the body in health/
^ I know, Alice, it is wrong to keep repining as I do, bu^
I cannot help it i you must bear with me.'
*I tvon't bear with you, if I can alter you,'replied mj
mother : but the harshness of her words was undone by Uw
earnest afi^ection of her tone and pleasant sinile* that made
my father smile agaioj less sadly and less tranaiently than
was his wont.
* Mamma,'said I, as soon as I could £nd an opporttmity
of speaking with her alone,'my money is but little, and cac-
not last long ; if I could increase it, it would lessen papa';

anxiety all d & y long : but next time I am determined to take
things coolly/
After some further disoussion, my mother promised once
more to Oissist me, provided I would wait and be patient ; aad
I left her to broach the matter to my father, when and how
she deemed it moat advisable: never doubting her ability
to obtain his consent. Meantime, I searched, with great
Interest, the advertising columns of the newspapers, and
wrote answers to every'Wanted a Governess'that appeared
at all ehgible ; but all my letters, as well as the rephes, when
I got any, were dutifully shown to my mother ; and she, to
my chagrin* made me reject the situationa one after another:
these were low people, these were too exacting In their de-
mands, and theae too niggardly in their remuneration.
'Your talents are not such as every poor clergyman'a
daughter possess^, Agnes/ she would say, * and you most
not throw them away. Kemember, you promised to be
patient : there is no need of hurry : you have plenty of
time before you, and may have many chances yet.*
At length, she advised me to put an advertxsement,
myself^ in the paper, stating my qnalihcations, dso*
'Music, singing, drawing, Prench, Latin, and Gennan,'
said she, ^are no mean assemblage: many will be glad to
have so much in one instructor ; and this time, you
shall try your fortune in a somewhat higher family—
ID that of some genuine, thorough-bred gentleman ; for
such are far more likely to treat you with proper respect and
consideration than those purse-proud tradespeople and
arrogant upstarts, I have known several among the higher
ranks who treated their govemeasea quite as one of the
family ; though some, I allow, are as ui & olent and exacting
aa any one else can be : for there are bad and good in all
classes. "
The advertisement was quickly written and despatched.
Of the two parties who answered it, but oue would oonaent
to give me Miy pounds, the sum my mother bade me nama
as the salary I should require ; and here, I hesitated thouJk

engaging myself, as I feared the children would be too old,
and their paxents would require some one more showyj or
more experienced, ii not more accomplished than I* But my
mother dissuaded me from declining it on that account ; I
should do vastly welli she said, if I would only throw aside
my dif^dence^ and acquire & little more confidence in
myself. I was just to give a plaia, true statement of my
acquirements and qualifications, and name what stipuLattouB
I chose to make, and then await the result. The only
stipulation I ventured to propose, was that I might he
allowed two months'holidays during tho year to \'isit my
friends, at Midsummer and Christmas* The unknown lady,
in her reply, made no ohjection to this, and stated that, as to
my ocquirementSj she had no douht I should be able to give
satisfaction ; but in the engagement of governesses she con-
sidered thoGe things as but subordinate points ; as bemg
dituflted in the neighbourhood of O— — -, she could get
masters to supply any deficiencies in that respect ; but, in
her opinionj next to ummpeauhable morality, a mild and
oheerful temper and obliging dispositioii were the most
essential requisities.
My roother did not relish this at all, and now made
many objections to my accepting the situation ; in which
my Bifiter warmly supported hai': but, unwilling to be
balked again, I overruled them all ; and, having first obtained
the consent of my father (who had, a short time previously,
been apprised of these transactions), I wrote a most obHging
epistle to my unknown correBpondent, and, finally, the
bargain was concluded.
It was decreed that on the last day of January I was to
enter upon my new office as governess in the family of
Mr. Murray^ of Horton Lodge, nfear O 1 about seventy
milee from our village : a formidable distance to me, as I
had never been above twenty miles from home in all the
course of my twenty years'sojourn on earth ; and as,
moreover, every individual in that family and in the neigh-
bourhood was utterly unknown to myself and all my

near a large town, and not in a manufacturing district, whem
the people had nothing to do but to make money ; his nnk
from what I could gather, appeared to be higher than that of
Mr. Bloomfield ; and, doubtless, he was one of those genuine
thorough-bt^ed gentry my mother apoke of, who would trwl
hia govern eaa with due consideration ae a respectable well-
educated lady, the instructor and guide of bis children, and
not a mere upper servant. Then, my pupils being older,
would be more rational, more teachable, and less troublesome
than the last ; they would be lesa conBned to the echoolroom,
and not require that constant labour and incessant watchbg ;
and, finally, bright visions mingled with my hopes, with
which the care of children and the mere duties of a govenxeu
had little or nothing to do. Thus, the reader vnll see that I
had no olaim to be regarded ae a martyr to £Ii & l piety, going
lorth to saorifioe peace and liberty for the sola purpose d
laying Qp stores for the comfort and support of my parents :
though certainly the comfort of my father^ and the fatuxt
support of my mother, had a large share in my calculations ;
and fifty pounds appeared to me no ordinary buhl I must
have decent olothea becoming my station; I must» itGoemed,
put out my washing, and also pay for my (oar anansl
joumeyB between Horton Lodge and home ; but mlh stiid
attention to economy, surely twenty pounds, or little more,
would cover those expenses^ and then there would be thirty
for the bank, or little less'what a valuable addidon to our
stock 1 Oh, I must struggle to keep this situation, wbatevef
it might be I both for my own honour among my friends and
for the solid services I might render then3 by my oontinnaDcs i

HOIITON LODOB
'he 31st of January was a wtM, tempestuous day : tbere
was a strong north win < 3» > vith a contieual sfcorm of snov?
drifting on the ground and whirling through the air. My
friends would havo had mo dalay my departure, but fearful
of prejudicing my etnployers against me by such want of
puHGtualily at the commencement of my undertaking, I
peraistod in keeping the appointment.
I will not inflict upon my readers an account of my
leaving home on that dark winter morning : the fond
farewells, the long, long journey to O , the solitary
waitings in inns for coaches or trains^for there were some
railways then — and, finally^ the meeting at O with
Mr. Muiray 6 servant, who had been sent with the phaeton
to drive me from thence to Horton Lodge. I will just
state that the heavy snow had thrown such impedimenta in
the way of both horses and steam-engtnes, that it was dark
some hours before I reaehed my journey's end, and that a
most bewildering storm camo on at last, which made the
few miles'space between O and Horton Lodge a long
and formidable passage. I eat resigned, with the cold,
sharp snow drifting through my veil and filling my lap^
seeing nothing, and wondering how the unfortunate horso
and driver could make their way even as well as they did ; and
indeed it was but a toilsome, creeping style of progression, to
say the best of it. At length we paused ; and, at the call of
the driver, someone unlatched and rolled back upon their

creaMng hjcgeg vh & t ftppeafed to be the park gfttes. Then
we pri!kc£eded along a amoother road, whence, oecvoama^y, I
peroeived some huge, hoary mass gle & mmg throng iht
darlczies9» which I took to be a portion of a Know-d^ ten.
After a ooDsider & ble dnie we paused again, before the stalelj
pordoo of a large house witli long windows descending to ^
ground.
I rose with some diffieolty from under the saperinoDA-
bent anowdiift, and alighted from the carriage, expecting
th & t a kind and hospitable rooeptioQ would indemnify me
for the toils and hardships of the day. A gentlemsulj
person in bUck opened the door, and admitted me into a
spacious hall, lighted by an amber-coloured lamp sus-
pended from the ceiling ; he led me through this, aloug a
fniooiigr. and opening the door of a back room, told me that
waa the schoolroom. I entered^ and found two 3''ouiig ladiei
and two young gentlemen — my future pupils, I supposed.
After a formal greeting, the elder girl, who was trifling over
a piece of canvas and a basket of German wools, asked if I
ahould like to go upstairs^ I replied in the affirmative, of
ooorae.
*■ Matilda, take a candls, and show her her room/ said she.
Miss Matilda, a strapping hoyden of about fourteen, with
a short frock and trousers, shragged her shoulders and made
a slight gnmaoe, bat took a candle and proceeded b6f < H« me
up the back stairs (a long, steep, double flight), and through
a Iong» narrow passage, to a sniall but tolerably comfortable
room. She then asked me if I would take some tea or
ooSee^ I was about to answer No ; but remembering th & t I
had taken nothing since seven o'clock that morning, and
feeling faint in consequence, t said 1 would take a cup of
tea. Saying she would tell'Brown,* the young lady
departed ; and by the time I had divested myself of mj
heavy, wet doak, shawl, bonnet, Ac., a mincing damsel osme
lo say the young ladies dedred to know whether I wodd
take my tea up dsere or in the schoolroom. Under the pies
of fatigue I ohose to take it there. She withdrew ; and,
AGNES GREY
iiS
K
^^c
Ebfter a wbi]@, returned agiun with a small tea-tray, and
placed it on the chest of drnwera^ which served as a dressing-
table. Having civilly thanked her, I asked at what time I
should be expected to rise in the morning*
'The young ladies and gentlemen breakfast at half-past
eightj ma'am/ said she ; * they rise early \ but^ as they
seldom do any lessons before breakfast, I should think it will
do if you rise soon after seven.'
I dBsired her to be 80 kind as to call me at seven, and,
promising to do so, she withdrew. Then, having broken my
long fast on a cup of tea and a little thin bread and butter,
I sat down beside the small, smouldering fire, and amused
myself with a hearty fit of crying \ after which, I said my
prayers, and then, feeling considerably relieved, began to
prepare for bed. Finding that none of my luggage was
brought up, I instituted a search for the hell ; and failing to
discover any signs ol such a convenience in any corner of
the room, I took my candle and ventured through the long
passage, and down the steep stairs, on a voyage of discovery*
Meeting a well-dressed female on the way, I told her what
I wanted ; hut not without considerable hesitation, as I was
not quite sure whether it was one of the upper servants, or
Mrs. Murray herself : it happened, however, to be the lady's-
maid. With the air of one conferring an unusual favour,
she vouchsafed to undertake the sending up of my things \
& nd when I had re-entered my room^ and vraited and
wondered a long time (greatly fearing that she had forgotten
or neglected to perform her promise, and doubting whether
keep waiting or go to bed, or go down again), my
opes, at length, were revived by the sound of voices and
laughter, accompanied by the tramp of feet along the
passage ; and presently the luggage was brought in by a
rough-looking maid and a man, neither of them very respect-
ful in their demeanour to me. Having shut the door upon
their retiring footsteps, and unpacked a few of my things, I
betook myself to rest ; gladly enough, for I was weary in
body and mind.

I descended to the schoolroom with no remarkable
eagerness to join my pupils, though not without some feeling
of curiosity respecting what a further acquaintance would
reveal. One thing, among others of more obvious importance,
I determined with myself — I must begin with calling them ^
Miss and Master. It seemed to me ft chilling and unuaturalS
piece of punctilio between the children of a family and their
instructor and daily companion ; especially where th«
former were in their early childhood, as at Wellwood
House ; but even there» my calling the little BloomBeldfl
by their simple names had been regarded as an ofiTensive
hberty ; as their parents had taken care to show me» by
carefully designating them Master and Miss Bloomfeld^ & o.,


AGNES GBEY
415
in speaking to me. I hoA been very slow to take tbe hint,
because the whole affair struck me as so very absurd ; but
now I determined to be wiser, and begin at once with aa
much {orm and eeremouy as any member of the family would
be Ukely to require : and, indeed, the children being ao much
older^ there would be les* difficulty ; though the little words
Mies and Mivster eeemed to have a surprising effect in
repressing all familiar, open-hearted kindness, and ex-
tinguishing every gleam oi cordiality that might arise be*
tween us.
As I cannot, like Dogberry, £nd it in my heart to bestow
all my tediousness upon the reader, I will not go on to bore
him with a minute detail of all the diBooyeries and proceed-
ings of this and the following day. No doubt he will be
amply satisied with a slight sketch of the different members
of the family, and a general view of the fii'st year or two of
my sojourn among them.
To begin with the head : Mr. Muiiray was, by all aocounts,
a blustering, royatering^ country squire : a devoted fox-
hunter, a skilful horse-jockey and fairier, an active, practical
farmer^ and a hearty bon vivani. By all accounts, I say ;
for, except on Sundays, when he went to church, I never
saw him from month to month : unless, in crossing the hall
or walkiug in the grounds, the figure of a tall, stout gentle-
man, with scarlet cheeks and crimson nose^ happened to
come across me ; on which occasions, if he passed near enough
to speak, an unceremonious nod, accompiiuied by a'Morn-
ing, Misa Grey,'or some such brief salutation, was usually
vouchsafed. Frequently, indeed, his loud laugh reached me
from afar ; and oftener still I heard him swearing and blas-
pheming against the footmen, groom, coachman, or some
^pther hapless dependant. ■
Mrs, Murray was a handsome, dashing lady of forty, who
'certainly required neither rouge nor padding to add to her
charmB; and whose chief enjoyments were, or seemed to be.
In giving or frequenting parties, and in dressing at the very
of the fashion^ I did not see her till eleven o'clock on

416
AGNES GREY

the momiDg after my arrival ; wben she bonoured me wiiK
a visit, just as my mother might step into the kitchen to & ee
a new servant girl : yet not so^ either, for my mother would
have seen her inunediatBly after her arriv[Llj and not wai
till the next day ; and, moreover, she would have ad <
her in a more kind and friendly manner, and given her
words of comfort as well as a plain exposition of her
but Mrs. Murray did neither the one nor the other. S
stepped into the schoolroom on her return from ordering
dinner in the housekeeper's rcwm, bade me good-morning,
stood for two minutes by the fire, said a few words about the
weather and the • rutber rough'journey I must have had
yesterday ; petted her youngest child — a boy of ten— who
had just been wiping his mouth and hands on her gown*
after indulging in some savoury morsel from the house-
keeper's store ; told me what a sweet, good boy he was ; imd
then sailed out, with a self -complacent smile upon her face ;
thinking, no doubt, that she had done quite enough for the
present, and had been delightfully coadescending into the
bargain. Her children evidently held the SEime opiuiou, and
I aloDB thought otherwise.
After this she looked in upon me once or twice, during
the absence of my pupils, to enlighten me conceming my
duties towards them. For the girls she seemed anxious
only to render them as & U| > er£cially attractive and showily
accomplished as they could possibly be made, without pre-
sent trouble or discomfort to themselves ; and I was to ad
aocordiugly^to study and strive to amuse and oblige, instnu^
refine, and poUsh, with the least possible exertion on tbeir
part, and no esercise of authority on mine. With regard lo
the two boys, it was much the same ; only instead of aocom-
plishments, I was to get the greatest possible quantity of
Latin gi*ammar and Valpy's Delectus into their heads, in
order to fit them for school — the greatest possible quantity »i
least without trouble to themselves. John might be a'Uttle
high-spirited/ and Charles might be a little * aerrous and
tedious —'

'Bnt at all events, Miaa Grey,'said she,'I hope you will
keep your temper, & nd he mild and patient throughout ;
eapeoially with the dear little Chitrlea ; he ie so extremely
nervous and suscepubloj and so utterly unaccuaiomed to
auythicg but the tenderest treatment. You will excuse my
naming these things to you ; for the fact is, I have hitherto
found all the governesses, even the very best of them, faulty
in this particular. They wanted that meek and quiet spint,
which St. Matthew, or some of themj saya is better than the
putting on of apparel^you will know the passage to which I
allude, for you are a clergyman's daughter. But I have no
doubt you will give fiati & faction in this respect ae well as the
rest. And remember, on aU occaaiotis, when any of the
young people do anything improper, if persuasion acd gentle
remonstrance ^vill not do, let one of the others come and tell
me ; for I can speak to them more plainly than it would be
proper for you to do. And make them as huppy as you can,
Miss Grey, and I dare say you will do very well.*
I observed that while Mrs. Mun-ay was so extremely
solicitous for the comfojrt and happiness of her childrenp and
continually talking about it, she never once mentioned mine ;
though they were at home, surrounded by friends, and I an
alien among strangers ; and I did not yet know enough of
the world, not to be considerably surprised at thia anomaly*
Miss Murray, otherwise Rosalie^ was about sixteen when I
oame,and decidedly a very pretty ^rl ; and in two years longer,
aa time more completely developed her form and added grace
to her carriage and deportment, she became positively beauti-
ful; and that in no common degree. She was tall and
slender, yet not thin ; perfectly formed, exquisitely fair,
though not without a bnlliant, healthy bloom; her hair,
which she wore in a profusion of long ringlets, was of a very
light brown inclining to yellow ; her eyea were pale blue, but
80 clear and bright that few would wish them darker ; the
rest of her features were small, not quite regular, and not
remarkably otherwise : but altogether you could not hesitate
pronounpe her a very lovely girL I wish I could Bay as

much for mind and dispaaltion oa I o & a for her form and
fftoe.
Yet think not I have any dreadful diBclo & tiTefi to ouJcb;
Bbe waiS lively, li^ht-heatted, and could be very agreeable,
with those who did not oroBS her will. Towards mej when I
hv & t came, Bhe was oold and haughty, then inaolent and
overbearing ; but, on a further acquEbintanoey ehe gradually
laid aside her aim, and in time became as deeply attibched ta
me as it was poswiblt^ for h^r to be to one of my eharaoter and
position : for ahe eeldom lost sight, for above half an hour at
a time, of the fact of my being a hireling and a poor ci]r & t«*«
daughter. And yet, upon the whole, I believe she reepeott.'d
me more than she herself was aware of; because I was th«|
only person in the house who Bbeadily professed good prind-
ples, habitually spoke the truth, and generally endeavour & d to
make inclination bow to duty; and this I aay, not, of oour«.
in commendation of myself, but to show the unfortunate
state of the family to which my Eiervteea were, for the pre660t,
devoted. Thf^re was no member of it in whom I regratted
this sad want of pnnoiple & o much ag Miss Morray herself;
not only beoauae she had taken a fancy to me, but beouue
there was bo much of wliat wivs pleasant and preposseaaiiig
in herself, that, in spite of her failings, I really liked her—
when she did not rouse my indignation, or ruffle my tempsr
by too groat a display of her faults. Thesei however, I would
fain persuade myself were rather the e &'eai of her educatioQ
than her disposition : slie had never been pei'fectly lAught
the distinction between right and wrong ; she had, like her
brothers and sifters, been suffered, from infancy, to tyrannLte
over nurses, governesses, and sei-vanis ; abo had not btjen
taught to moderate her desii'es* to control her temper or
bridle her will, or to sacrifice her oNvn pleasure for the good
of others. Her temper being naturally good, fihe was never
violent or morose^ but from constant indulgence, and hftfat-
tual scorn of raaF^on, she was often testy and oapriciouB ; htt
mind had never b«en cultivated: her intellect, at best, vfU
somewhat shallow ; uhe posaeased considerable vivaeity,


AGNES GREY
qaiokness of perception, and some talent for muBio and the
aoquisilion of Ifrnguagea, hut tilJ fifteen ahs had troubled
herself to acquire nothing ; — then the love of display hsA
roua & d her faculties, and indueed her to apply herself, but
only bo the more ahowy aooomplishmenta. And when I
cante it waatho Bume: everything \va»S neglected bat French,
Gorman, muaic, singing, dancing, fancy-work, and a little
drawing— such drawing as might produce the greateat show
vrith the smallest labour, and the principal parts of which
were generally done by mo. For music and singing, be«doa
my ocoasional instructions, she had bhe attendu.nce of the besb
tsafiter the countiy afforded ; and in these aooomplishment^
as well as in dancing, Bhe certainly attained great proficiency.
To rausio, indeed, she devoted too much of har time, as,
governess though I was, I frequently told her ; but bor
mother thought that if she likod it, sho coukl not give too
muoh time to the aoquisition of bo atiraotive an art. Of
fancy-work I knew nothing but what I gathered from roy
pupil and my own observation ; but no sooner was I initiated,
than she made me useful in twenty different waya ; all the
tedious parts of her work were shifted on to my shoulders ;
such as stretching the frames, stibohing in the canvas, sorting
the wools and silks, putting in the grounds, counting the
stitches, rectifying mistakes^ and finishing the pieces she was
tired of.
At sixteen, Miss Murray was somothingof aromp^yet not
more so than is natural and allowahlo for a girl of that age,
but at seventeen, that propensity, like all other things, began
to give way to the ruling passion, and soon was swallowed
up In the all-abaorbing ambition to attract and das^xle tlie
other sex. But enough of her ; now let us turn to hw
sister.
Mias Matilda Murray was a veritable hoyden, of whom
Uttle ne«d be said. Sho was about two years and a half
younger than her sister ; her features were larger^ her com-
plexion much darker. She might possibly make a handsome
woman ; but she was far too big-boned and awkward ever to


4ai»
AGNEB GREY
be cjiUed a pretty girl, ajid At present she cared tittle ibbout
it, Kosulie knew OpU her charms, and thought them even
greater than they were, and valued them mors highly than
she ought to have done, had they been three times as great ;
Matilda thought she %vas well enough, but c^ed little Ekbout
the matter ; still less did she care about the cultivation of
her mixtcl, and the acquisition of ornamental accomplishments.
The manner in which she leanit her lessons and practised her
mudo was calculated to drive any governess to despair
Short and easy as her ta & kB were, if done at all, they were
slurred over, at any time and in any way ; but generally at
the least convenient times, and in the way least beneBcial to
herself, and least satisfactoiy to me : the short half-hour of
practising was horribly strummed through ; she, naeanttme,
utispaiingly abusing me, either /or interrupting her with
corrections, or for not rectifying her mistakes before they were
madoj or something equally unreasonable. Once or twice, I
ventured to remonstrate with her seriously for such irrational
conduct ; but on each of those occasions, I received such re-
prehensive expostulations from her mother, as convinced me
that, if I wished to keep the situation, I must even let Miss
Matilda go on in her own way.
When her lessons were over, however, her ill-humour wm
generally over too : while riding her spirited pony, or romping
with the dogs or her brothel's and sister, but especially with
her dear brother John, she was as happy as a lark. As an
animal, Matilda was all right, full of life, vigour, and activity ;
as an intelligent being, she was barbarously ignorant, indo-
cile, careless and irrational ; and, consequently, very distress-
ing to one who had the task of cultivating her understanding,
reforming her manners, and aiding her bo acquire thofifi
ornamental attainments which, unlike her sisteTp she ddspised
as much as the i*esti. Her mother was partly aware of her
deficiencies, and gave me many a lecture as to how I should
try to form her tastes, and endeavour to rouse and cherish
her dormant vanity ; and, by insinuating, skilful flattery, la
win her attention to the desired objects — which I would

not do ; and how I should propstre £knd smooth bhe patih of
learnmg till she could glido ulong it without tho least oxertioQ
to herself ; which I could not, for nothing can be taught to
any purpose without Bom & Uttlo exertion on the part of the
learner,
Aa a moral agent, Matild^k was reckless, headstrong,
violent^ and unamonable to reason. One proof of the de-
plorahle state of her mind vi^aB, thort from her father's example
she had learned to swear like a trooper. Her mother was
gieatly shocked at the'unlady-like trick/ and wondered'how
she had picked it up/ * But you can soon break her of it^
Miijs Grey/ said she ;'it is only a habit ; and if you will just
gently remind her every time she does so^ I am sure she will
Boon lay it aside.'I not only * gently reminded'her, I tried to
impress upon her how wrong it was, and how distressing to
the ears of decent, people ; but all in vain : I was only
answered by a careless langh, andj *0h, Miss Grey^ how
shocked you are ! I'm so glad V or,'Well J I can't help it ;
p & pa shouldn't have taught me : I learned it all from him ;
and maybe a bit from the coachma.n/
Her brother John, alias Master Murrayi was & bout
eleven when I came : a fine, stout, healthy boy, frank and
good-natured in the main, and might have been a decent lad
had he been properly educated ; but now he was aa rough
as a young bear, boisterous, unruly, unprincipled, untaught,
unteachable^-at least, for a governess under his mother's
eye* His masters at school might be able to manage him
better^for to school he was sent^ greatly to my relief, in the
course of a year ; in a state, it is true, of scandalous Igno-
rance as to Latin, as well as the more useful though more
neglected things : and this, doubtless, would all be laid to
the account of his education having been entrusted to an
ignorant female teacher, who had presumed to take in hand
what she was wholly incompetent to perform. I was not
delivered from his brother till full twelve months after, when
he also was det^patohed in the same state of disgraceful
ignorance as the former.

cowardly, capricious, selfish Little fellow, only active in
doing mischief, and only clever jo inventing falsehoods : tiot
elmply to hide his faults, but, in mere maliciona waDtonnaBS,
to bring odium upon others. In fact* Mftster Charlee was %
^fery great nuisance bo me ; il was a trial of patience to livB
with him peaceably ; to watch over him was wor^e ; Kod to
teach him, or pretend to teach him* waa inoonceiTable^ At
ten years old, he could not read correctly the easiest line in
the simpleBt book ; and as, according to his mother*!
principle, he was to he told every word, before he had time
to hesitate or examine its orthography^ and never even to be
informed, as a stimulant to exertiou* that other boys were
l & ore forward than he, it in not surprising that be made but
little progress during the two yeans I had charge of hifi
education. His minute portiona of Latin gramni & rf J^,
were to be repeated over to him, till be (diofie to Bay ho

made mistakes in his little eoay sums in arithmetic, they
were to bo shown him at once, and the sum done for him,
instead of his being left to exercise his faculties in finding
them out himgelf ; so that, of course, he took do pains to
avoid mistakes, but frequently set down his figorea afi
random, without any calctiUtion at all.
I did not invariably confine myself to theee rules : It wm
against my conscience to do so ; but I seldom could venture
to deviate from them in the slightest degree, witbout
incurring the wrath of my little pupil, and subseqtientiy of
his mamma; to whom he would relate my transgresdonfi

A few more ohservationa about Horton Lodge and its
ongoings, and I have done with dry description for the
present. The house was a very respectable one ; superior
to Mr. Bloamfield'a, both in age, size, and magnificence ; the
garden was nob bo tastefully laid out ; but instead of the
smooth-shaven lawn, the young trees guai'ded by palings,
the grove of upstart poplara, and the plantation of firs, there
was a vdde park, stocked with deer, and beautified hy fine
old trees. The surrounding country itself waa pleasant, as
far as fertile fields, flourishing trees, quiet green lanes, and
gtniling hedges with wild-flowers scattered along their
banks, could make it ; hut il was depressingly flat to ona
bom and nurtured among the rugged hills of .
We were situated nearly two miles from the village
church, and, consequently, the family carriage was put in
requisition every Sunday morning, and sometimes oftener.
Mr. and Mrs, Murrivy generally thought tt sufiQcient to show
themselves at church once in the coiuse of the day ; but fre-
quently the children preferred going a second time to
wandering about the groundi^ all the day with nothing to do.
If some of my pupils chose to walk and take me with them,
kt waa well for me ; for otherwise my position in the
carriage was, to be crufihod into the corner farthest from the
open window, and with my baek to the horsoa : a position
which invariably made me dek; and if I were not actually
obliged to leave the church in the middle X)f the servicG, my
devotions were disturbed with a feeling of languor and
sickliness, and the tormenting fear of its becoming worse :
and a depressing headache was generally my compantoii
throughout the day, which would otherwise have been one of
welcome rest, and holy, calm enjoyment,

might have answered ; but in t^demess for their feelings I
only replied, —'Oh I it is but a short " way* and 11 I am not
eick in churcht I don*t mind it/
If I were called upon to give a description of the usual
diviaiona and arrangements of the day, I should find
very difficult matter. I hud all my meals in the schoo
with my pupils^ at such tiines as suited their fancy :
times they would ring for dinner before it was half cooked
sometimes they would keep it wailing on the table for above
an houTj and then be out of humour because the potatoes were
cold, and the gravy covered with co^kesof sohd fat ; sometimes
they would have tea at four ; frequently ^ they would atoraa
at the servants because it was not In precisely at five ; and
when these orders were obeyed, by way of encouragement
to punctualityi they would keep it on the table tiU seven or
eight.
Their hours of study were managed in much the saine
way ; my judgment or convenienoe was never once cousulu^.
Sometimes Matilda and John would determine'to get all
the plaguy business over before breakfast/ and send the
maid to call me up at half-past five, without any scruple or
apology ; sometimes^ I was told to be ready precisely at six,
and, having dressed in a hurry, came down to & n empty
room» and after waiting a long time in suspenaai dlsoownd
that they had changed their minds, and were still in bed ; or,
perhapsi if it were a fine summer morning, Brovvn veonld
come to tell me that the young ladies and gentlemen h^d
taken a holiday, and were gone out; and then I was kept
waiting for breakfast till I was almost ready to faint : ^nef
having fortified themselves with something before they

Often they would do their lessons in the open air ; which
I had nothing to say against : except that I frequently G«aght

cold by sittaDg on the damp grass, or from exposure to the
eveaiDg dew, or some insidious draughtj which seemed to
have no injm'ious effect on them. It was quite right that
they should be hardy; yet, surely, they might have been
taught some consideration for others who were less so. But
I must not blame them for what was, perhaps, my own
fault ; for I uever made any particular objections to sitting
where they pleased ; foolishly choosing to risk the conse-
quences, rather than trouble them for my convenience.
Their indecorous manner of doing their lessons was quite as
remarkable aa the capiice displayed in their choice of time
and place. While receiving my instmclions, or repeating
what they had learned, they would lounge upoa the sofa, lie
on the nig, stretch, yawn, talk to each other, or look out of
the window ; whereas, I could not so much as stir the fire,
or pick up the handkerchief I had dropped, without being
rebuked for inattBction by one of n > y pupils, or told that
'mamma would not like me to be so careless.'
The sen'afits, seeiag in what little estimation the
governess was held by both parents and children, regulated
their behaviour by the same standard* I have frequently
stood up for them, at the risk of some injury to myselfr
against the tyranny and injustice of their young masters and
mistresses ; and I always endeavoured to give them as little
trouble as possible : but they entirely neglected my comfort,
despised my requests, and slighted my directions. All
servants, I am convinced, would not have done so ; hut
domestics in general, being ignorant and little accustomed to
roason and reflection, are too easily corrupted by the care-
lessness and bad eisamplc of those above them ; and these, I
think, were not of the best order to begin with.
I sometimes felt myself degraded by the life I led, and
ashamed of submitting to so many indignities ; and some-
times I thought tuyself a fool for caring so much about them,
aind feared I must be sadly wantingin Christian humility.or that
charity which'suffereth long and is kind, sccketh not her own,
not easily provoked, beaieth all bhiugSj cndurtth all things/

But, with time s.n3. patience, matters bega > n to be slightly
ameliorated : slowly^ it h true, and altnoBt Lmperceptibly ; but
I got rid of my male pupils (that was no trifling addvaniage)p
and the girls, as I intimated before concerning one of them, be-
came a little less insolent, and began to show some symptoms
of esteem.'Misa Grey was a queer creature : she never
flattered, and did not praise them half enough ; but when-
ever she did & pcn.k favourably of them, or anything belonging
to them, they could be quite Biir« her approbation w & s
sincere. She was very obliging, quiet, and peaceable in the
main, but there wore some things that put her out ol temper:
they did not much care for that, to be sure, but still it waa
better to keep her in tune ; as when she was in a good
humour she would talk to them, and be very agreeable md
amusing sometimes, in her way ; which was quite di£fereiit
to mamma's, but still very well for a cha.ngB. She had her ^
o\vzi opinions on every subject, and kept steadily to tJiem^ ■
very tiresome opinions they often were ; as she was alwaj-s
thinking of what was right and what was ^vrong| and had a
strange reverence for matters connected with religion, and ,
Bjx unaccountable liking to good people.*

THE'COMINO OUT*'

At eigbteen^ Hiss Mumvy was to emerge from the quiet
obecarity of the schoolroom into the full hluze of the
faBbionable world — aa much of it, ab least, as eould be hckd
out of London ] for her papa coidd not be persuaded to leave
his rural pleasurea and pursuits, even for a, few weeks*
residence in town. 8he was to make her dSbut ou the
third of January, at a magnificent bull, which her mamma
proposed to give to nil the nobility and choice gentry of
O and its neighbourhood for twenty miles round. Of
oourse, she looked forward to it with the wildest impatience,
and the most extravagant anticipations of delight.
'Miss Grey,'said she, one evenings a month before the
-important day^ as I was perusing a, long and eittremely
Interesting letter of my sister's^whlch I had just glanced at
in the morning to see that it contained no very bad ne%v9,

and listen to me 1 I'm sure my talk must be far more
amusing than that.'
Bhe seated herself on the low stool at my feet ; and I,
suppressing a sigh of vexation, began to fold up the
epistle.
* You should tell the good people at home not to bore you
with such long letters,'said & he ;'and, above all, do bid

Meltham and Sir Broadley Wilson are old codgora, only fit
companions for pupa and mamma. Sir Thomas is young,
rich, and gay ; but an ugly beast, nevertheless : however,
matnma says I should not mind that after a faw mouths'ac-
quaintance. Then, there was Hem-y Meltham, Sir Hugh's
younger son ; rather good-looking^ and a pleasant follow to
flirt with : but bcijig a younger son, that is all he is good
for; then there waa young Mr. Green, rich enough, but of
no family, and a great stupid fellow, a mere country booby I
and then, our good rector, Mr. Hatfield ; an hujublc admirer
he ought to considei'himself ; but I fear he haa forgotteD to
number humility among bis stock of Cbh & tiau virtues.'
■ Was Mr. Hatfield at the ball ?'
I * Yes, lo be bure. Did you think he was too good to
go?'\
'I thought he might consider it unclerical/
'By no means. He did not profane his oloth by dan*
oing ; but it was with difficulty he could refrain, poor roan :
he looked as if he were dying to ask my hand ju & t for one
set ; and — oh I by-the-by — he's got a new curate : that seedy
old fellow Mr. Bligh has got his loug-wished-for living at

Then she returned to the ball, and gave me a further
account of her deportment there, and at the several parties
she had since attended ; and further particulars respecting
Sir Thomas Ashby and Jfessra, Meltham, Green, and Hat-
field, and the ineffaceable impression she had wrought upon
each of them.
'Well, which of the four do you like beat ?'said I, sup-

dislike that cast of countenance : but the only thing I

which appeared to me good^— infinitely better, at leasts thaa
Mr. Hatfield's, He resd the Lessons as if he were bent on
^viug fuU effect to every passttge ; it seemed as if the most
ctkTeless person could not have helped attending, nor the most
ignorant have failed to understand ; and the prayers he read
as if he were not reading at all, but praying earnestly and
Binoerely from his own heart/
* Ob, yes, that's all be is good for : he can plod tbroug'i
the service well enough ; but he baa not a single idea
beyond it.'
'How do you know ? *
'Oh t I know perfectly well ; I am an excellent judge in

never looking bo the right hand or the left, and evideol
thinking of notliing but just getting out of the church, fuid,

hostility*
'Indeed I I shanld have been highly indignant if he had
dared to do such a thing 1'replied she, haughtily tossing her

Did you see how Mr. Hatfield hiirried out to get a bow froni
met and be in time to put us into the carriage ?'
'Yes,'answered I ; internally adding,'and I thought H
somewhat derogatory to his dignity as a clergyman to come
3yiug from the pulpit in such eager haste to shake hands
with the squire, and hand hia wife and daughters into theif
carriage : and, moreover, I owe him a grudge for nearly
shutting me out of it * ; for^ in fact, though I was standing
before hi^ face, close beside the carriage Btepe, waiting to
get in, he would persist in putting them up and closing the
door, till one of the family stopped him by calling oul ihat
the governess was not in yet; then, without a word of
apology, he depai^ted, wishing them good-moming, and
leaving the footman to finish the business,
Nola bene. — Mr. Hatfield never spoke to me, neither did
Sir Hugh or Lady Meltham, nor Mr* Harry or Miss Meltham,
nof Mr, Green or his sistei^, nor any other lady or gentle-
man who frequented that church: nor, in fact, any one that
visited at Horton Lodge.
Miss Murray ordered the carriage again, in the aftemooD,
for herself and her sister : ^he said it was too cold for them
to enjoy themselves in the garden ; and besides, she believed
Harry Meltham would be at chm^h.'For,'said she,

Sundays : you would think he was quite a good Christian.
And you may go with \is, Miss Grey : I want you to see him ;
he IB so greatly improved since he returned from abroad —
you can't think I And besides^ then you will have an oppor-
tunity of ^eing the beautiful Mr. Weston again, and of
hearing him pi^ach/
I did hear him preach, and was decidedly plea.sed with
the evangehcal truth of hiB doctrine, as well as the earnest
simplicity of his manner, and the cleameas and force of hia
style. It was truly refreshing to hear such a sermon, after
being so long accustomed to fche dry^ prosy discourses of the
former curate, and the still less edifying harangnea of the
rector. Mr. Hatfield would come sailing up the aisle, or
rather sweeping along like a whirlwind, with his rich silk
gown flying behind him and rustling against the pew doors,
mount the pulpit lilce a conqueror ascending his triumphal
car ; then, sinking on the velvet cushion in an attitude of
studied gracCi remain in gilent prostration for a certain time ;
then mutter over a Collectp and gabble through the Lord's
Prayer, rise, draw off one bright lavender glove, to give the
congregation the benefit of his sparkling rnigs, lightly pass
his fingers through his well-curled hair, flourish a cambric
handkerchief^ recite a very short passage, or^ perhaps, a mere
phrase of Scripture, as a head-piece to his discourse, and,
finallyi deliver a composition which, as a composilionj might
be considered good, though far too studied and too artificial
to be pleasing to ma : the propositions were well laid down,*
the arguments logically conducted ; and yet, it was some-
times hard to listen quietly throughout, without some slight
demonstration B of disapproval or impatience^
Hie favourite subjects were church discipline > rites and
oeremoniea, apostolical succession, the duty of reverence and
obedience to the clergy, the atrocious criminality of dissent,
the absolute necessity of observing all the forms of godliness,
the reprehensible presumption of individuals who attempted
to think for themselves in matters connected with rehgioUi
Qr to be guided by their own interpretations of Bcnpture,
438
AGKE3 GREY

and, CN^oasloDally (to please hiB ^eoltlty parialiloiiarB) ih«
necB & sity of deferential obedience from the poor to the Hcb
—supporting hia maximg and ejthortalionB tkronghout with
quot & ttOQa from the Fathers ; with whom he appeared to bs
far better acquainted than with the Apostles and Evangelists,
and whose importance he Beemed to consider at le^t equal
to theirs. But now and then he gave ua a sermon of a
different order^what some would call a very good one ; but
Bunless and severe : representing the Deity aa a terrible toek-
maater rather thEin a, benevoIeQt father. Yet» & & I listened,
I felt inclined to think the man was sincere in all be aaid:
be must have changed his views, and become decidadi;
religious, gloomy and ai:istere, yet BtlU devout. But siidi
illusions were usually dissipated, on coming out of church, bf
hearing hia voice in jocund colloquy with some of the Melthams
or Greens, or, perhaps, the Murrayfi themselves ; probftMy
laughing at his own sermon, and hoping that he had ^reo
the rascally people something to think about : perchance,
exulting in the thought that old Betty Holmes would now lay
aside the Binful indulgence of her pipe, which had been her
daily aolace for upwEurda of thirty years : that George Higgina
would be frightened out of his Sabbath evening wal^, and
Thomaa Jackson would be sorely troubled in his consoieitoej
and shaken in his sure and certain hope of a joyful reaurreo* ^
tlon at the last day. ■
Thus, I could not but conclude that Mr. Hatfield v^U'
one of those Vfho'bind heavy burdens, and grievous to be
borne, and lay them upon men's shoulders, while they them-
selves will not move them vdth one of their fingers'; anJ
who'make the word of God of none effect by their traditioas,
teaching for doctrines the commandments of men/ I wa3
weU pleased to observe that the new curate resembled him,
as far as I could see, in none of these particulars.
'WeU, Miss Grey, what do you think of him now?* said
Miss Murray, as we took our plaoes in the cuurugo After
service.
*Nq harm still/ replied I,

AGNES GREY

'No worse I I ahould think not indeed — quite the oon*-
traxy ! Is he not greatly improved ?'
* Oh, yes ; very much indeed.'replied I ; for I had now
discovered that it wa^ Harry Meltham she meant, not Mr,
Weston. Th & t gentleman had eagerly come forward to speak
to the young ladies : a thing he would hardly have ventured
to do had their mother been present ; he had likewise politely
handed them into the eariiaga. He had not attempted to
shut me out, like Mr. Hatfield ; neither, of course, had he
offerBd me his aaaistance (I should not have accepted it, if
he had), but a^ long as the door remained open he had stood
aniirking and chatting with them, and then lifted his hat and
departed to his own abode ; but I hiwi scarcely noticed him
all the time* My companions, however, had been more
observant', and, as we rolled along, they discussed between
them not only his looks, words, and actions, but every fetiture
of his face, and every article of hia apparel.

CHAPTER XT
THE COTTAGERS
ks I had now only one regular pupil — though she contrived
K > give me as much trouble as tht*0€ or four ordiDaj-y oEiea, and
tbough her sister still took lessansin German and drawing —
I had considerably more time at my own disposal thao I had
3ver been bles^ied with before, sinoa I Had taken upon me the
governess's yoke ; which time I devoted poi'tly to coiTespon-
lence with my friends, partly to reading, study, and the
practice of music, singing, & c., partly to wandering in the
grounds or adjacent fields^ with my pupils if they wanted me,
|doD6 if they did not.
Often, when they had no more agreeable occupation at
band, the Misses Murray %vould amuse themBelvea with
Halting the poor cottagers on their Eather*s estate, to receive
Iheir flattering homage, or to hear the old stories or gossiping
Dews of the garrulous old women ; or, perhaps, to enjoy the
purer pleasure of making the poor people happy with their
oheerijig presence and their occasional gifts, so easilybestowed,
BO thankfully received. Sometimes, I was called upon to
accompany one or both of the sisters in these visits ; and Bome^
^imes I was desired to go alone, to fulfil some promise which
piey had been more ready to make than to perform ; to carry
borne small donation, or read to one ^vho was sick or seriously
Hisposed : and thus I made a few acquaintances among the
isoUagers ; and^ occasionally, I wont to see them on my own
ftceount,
geoerally had more satisfaction in going alone than with

443

either o( the young ladles ; for they, cb.ie6y owing to their
defective education, comported themselves towards thmr b-
feriors in a majiner thut was highly diBagreeable for me to
witness. They oever, In thought, exchanged places with
them ; andj consequently, hod no coi^d deration for their
feelingSt regnrding them us an ordar of beingB entiiely
different from themselves. They would watch tlie poor uea-
tnres at their meFUs, making uncivil remarks about their food,
and their mannBi'of eating ; they would laugh at their simpb
notions and provlnciEJ expressions, till some of them scaroel;
durst venture to apeak ; they would call the grave elderiv
men and women old fools and silly old blockheads to their
faces : and all this without meaning to o^end. I could s^
that the people were often hurt and annoyed by such condnot,
though their fear of tho * grand ladies * prevented them from
testifying any resentment ; but they never perceived it. Th*jT
thought that] as these cottagers were poor and tuitanghtf tbej
must be stupid and brutish ; and as long aa they, tbeir
fiuperiors, condescended to talk to them, and to give than
Bhillingg and half-crowns, or articles of clothing, they hid &
right to amuBe themselves, even at their expense ; aod tht
people must adore them as angels of light, condescending to
minister to their neces & itieai and enlighten th^ humbl«
dwellings.
I made many and various attempts to deliver my pupib
from these ddlusive notions without alarming their priJe—
which was easily offended, and not soon appeased — but wilb
little apparent result ; and I know not which was the more
reprehensible of the two : Matilda was moi-e rude and bois-
terous ; but from Rosalie's womanly age and lady*like eitenor
better things were expected ; yet she was as provoMngly cut-
less and inconsiderate as a giddy child of twelve.
One bright day in the last week of Febraary, I was will-
ing in the park, enjoying the thi'eefold luxury of solitude, ^
book^ and pleasant weather; for Miss Matilda had set OQi
on her daily ride, and Miss Murray was gone in the
with her mamma to pay soma morning calUt ^ttl i^ *l

me tbatr I ought to leave these aelBsh pleasures, And the park
with its glorious canopy of bright blue aky, the west wind
sounding through its yet leafless brancbee, the snow-wreatha
still lingering in its hollows, but melting fast beneath the
sun, and the graceful deer browsing on its moist herbage
already aasiuning the freshneBS and verdure of spring — and
go to the cottage of one Nancy Brown, a widow, whose aon
waa ftt work all day in the fields, o^nd who was a£Qicted with
an inflammation in the eyes ; which had lor some time inca-
pacitated her from reading : to her own great grief, for she
was a woman of a serious, thoughtful turn of mind. I accor-
dingly went, and found her alone, as usual, in her little, close,
dark cottage, redolent of smoke and confined air, but as tidy
and clean as she could make it* She was seated beside her
little fire (conBi & ting of a few red cinders and a bit of stick),
busily knitting, with a Bmall sackcloth cushion at her feet,
placed for the accommodation of her gentle friend the cat, who
was seated thereon, with her long tail half oncirchng her
velvet paws, and her half-closed eyes dreamily gassing on the
low, crooked fender.
* Wellf Nancy, how are you to-day ? *
* Wby^ middling, Mi & s, i'myseLn— my eyes Is no better,
but I*m a deal easier i'my mind nor I have been/ replied she,
nsing to welcome me with a contented smile ; which I was
glad to see, for Nancy had been somewhat afiflicted with re-
ligious melancholy. I congratulated her upon the chnnge*
She agreed that it was a great hleRffing, and expressed herself
'right down thankful for it'; adding,'If it please God to
spare my sight, and make me so as I can read my Bible
again, I think I shall be as happy as a queen/
'I hope He will, Nancy,^ rephed I ;'and, meantime, I'll
oome and read to yon now and then, when I have a little
^^zne to spare/
^^P With expressions of grateful pleasure, the poor woman
^^■Doved to get me a chair ; but, as I saved her the trouble, she
^H^sied herself with slimng the Bre^ and adding a few mors
^Hifeicka to the decaying embers ; and then^ taking her well-used
444
AGNES GREY
Bible from the shelf, dusted it carefully, and gave it ma On
my asking if there wiia any particular port she should like
me to read, she answered^
'Well, Miss Grey, if it's all the same to you, I sboold like
to hear that chapter in the First Kpistle of St. John, th & l
says,''God is Iovb^ and he that dwelleth in love dwellelh ia
God, and God in him/''
With a little searching, I found these ^ords in the fooiUi
chapter. When 1 canto to the seventh verse she interrupted
me, and, with needlet > s apologies for such a liberty, desired
me to read it very slowly, that she might take it all in, and
dwell on every word ; hoping I would excuse her, as she was
but a'simple body/
* The wisest pomon/ I replied, * might ihink over each d
these verses for an hour, and bo all the better for it ; and I
would rather read them slowly than not/
Accordingly, J finished the chapter as slowly as need h$,
and at the game time as impressively ae I cotild ; my aoditor
listened most attentively all the while, and sincei'ely thaoW
me when I had done. I sat still about half a minute U > gi^
her time to reflect upon it; when, somewhat Uy my surprise,
she broke the pause by asking me how I Lked Mr, WestioQ ?
'I don't know/ I replied, a little startled by the sudden-
Eess of the question ;'I think he preaches very well/
* Ay, he does so ; and talks well too/
'Does he?'
'He does^ Maybe^ you haven't seen him — nob to t & lk to
him much, yet?*
'No, I never see any one to talk to — exoept the young
ladies of the Hall/
'Ah ; they're nice, kind young ladies ; but they can't tftUt
as be does/
'Then he comes to see you, Nancy ?'
'He does, Miss; and I'se thankful for it. He comes to
see all us poor bodies a doal ofter nor Maister Bligh, oc ih'
Rector ever did; an'it's wuU he does, for he's alwu) " *

house] they say he's auro to find aummui wrong, and begin
a-calling em as soon as he croseesth'doorstuDa ; but maybe
be thinks it his duty like to tell'em what'a vn-ozig. And
very oft he cjomes o* purpose to reprove folk for not coming
to chiirch, or not kneeling an'standing when other folk
does, or going to the Methody chapel, or aumtnuto'that sort :
but I can't say *at he ever fund much fault wi* me. He came
to see me once or twice, afore Maister Weston comej when
I was so ill troubled in my mind ; and as I had only very
poor health besides, I made bold to send for him — and he
came right enough. 1 was sore distressed, Miss Grey — thank
God^ it's owered no%v — but when I took my Bible, I could
get Qo comfort of it at all. That very chapter'at you've just
been reading troubled me as much as aught — " He that
loveth not, knoweth not God. " It seemed fearsome to me ;
for I felt that I loved neither God nor man as I should do,
and could not, if I tried ever so. And th'chapter afore,
where it says, — " He that is born of God cannot commit sin/'
And another place where it saye, — " Love is the fulfilling of
the Law, " And many, many otliers. Miss ; I should fair
wetiry you out, if I was to tell them all. But all seemed to
condemn me, and to show me'at I was not in the right way ;
and as I knew not how to get into it, I sent our Bill to beg
Maister Hatfield to be as kind as look in on me some day ;
and when he came^ I telled him all my troubles.
* And what did he say, Nancy ?'
'Why, Miss, he seemed to scorn me, I might be
mista'en — but he like gavB a sort of a whistle, and I saw a
Ht of a smile on lus fQ > ce ; and he said, " Oh, it's all stuff !
You've been among the Methodists, my good woman, "
But I telled him I'd never been near the Methodies. And
then he said,— " Well, " says he^ " you must come to church,
where you'll hear the Scriptures properly explained, instead
of sitting poring over your Bible at home, "
'But I telled him I always used coming to church when
I had my health ; but this very cold winter weather I hardly


AGNES GREY
durst venture so far— and me so bad wi'Ih'rhenma^
and all.
* But bfi says, " 1**11 do your rheumBiti^ g': > od to hobble to
church : there's nothing like exercise for the rheunmtiz.
You can walk about the hcuse well enough ; why can't you
walk to church? The fact is, " says he, ** you're getting too
fond of your ease. It's always oaey to & lid encases for
shirking one's dutyJ^
* But then, you know, Mi9s Grey, it wasn't so. Howot^.
I telled him Fd try. *'But please, sir/'says I, " if I do go
to church, what tho better shall I be? I want to have my
BLQs blotted out, and to feel that they are remembered do
more against me, and that the love of God is fihed abroad ia
my heart ; and if I can get no good by reading my Bible »n*
saying my prayers at home, what good shall I get by going
to church ?'
'" The church,''says he, " is the place appointed by God
for His worship. It's your duty to go there as often as pu
can. If you want comfort, you must seek it in the path of
duty, " — an* a deal more be said, but I cannot remember aH
his fine words. However, it all came to this, that I was to
come to church as oft as ever I could, and bring my prayer-
book with me, an'read up all ths spcnsers afier the clerk,
an'stand, an'kneel} an'sit, an'do all as I should, and take
the Lord's Supper at every opportunity, an'bearkea hi»
sermons, and Maister Bhgh's, an'it'ud be all right : U I
went on doing my duty, I should get a blessing at last.
''*But if you get no comfort that way, " aaya be» " it't
all up/'
*'* Then, sir, " s & ys I, ** Bhould you think I'm a reprobate? "

* But one Sunday, when Maister Hatfield gave out about
the sacrament, I noticed where he said, " If there be any of
you that cannot quiet his own conscience, but requireth
funher comfort or counsel, let him come to me, or some
othei'discreet and learned minister of God's word, and open
his grief I " 80 next Sunday morning, afore semce, I just
looked into the veatr)\ an* began a-talking to th'Kector
. I hardly could fashion to take such a Liberty, but I

4iB
AGNES GHEY
thought iffhen my eoul was at stake I shouldn't stick at a
Irifle. But he said he hadn't time to attend to me then.
• " And, indeed/* says he, ** I've nothing to say to yoa bat
what IVe said before. Take the eacnvmeot, of oom^, »ad
go on doing your duty ; & nd if that won't serro you, DOthiag
will. So don't bother me any more. "
'So then, I went away. But I heard Maieter Weston—
Maister Weston was there, Miss — this was his first Sundij
at Horton, you biow, an'he was i'th'vestry in his sniplioe,
helping th " Bector on with his gown *
* Yesj Nancy/
* And I heard him ask Maiater Hat & eld who I was; an'
he says, " Oh, she's a canting old fool. "
* And I was very ill grieved, Miss Grey ; but I went to
my seatj and I tried to do my duty as aforetime : but I like
got no peace. An'I even took the sacrament ; but I fell u
though I were eating and drinking to my own damnadon all
ih'time. 80 I want home, sorely troubled.
'But next day, afore I'd gotten fettled up — for indeed,
Miss, I'd no heart to sweeping an'fettling^ an'washing pots;
BO I sat me down i'th'muck— who should come in bul
Maister Weaton I I started siding stuff then, an'sweefung
an'doing ; and I expected he'd begin a-calling me for mj
idls ways, as Maister Hatfield would a* done ; but I waa
mista'en : he only hid me good-mornin'like, in a qui^t
dacent way. So I dusted him a chair, an'fettled up th'
fireplace a bit ; but I hadn't forgotten th* Eeotor*s words, eo
says I, " I wonder, air^ you should give yourself that trouble,
to come so far to see a'oanting old fool,'such as me/*
* He seemed taken aback at that ; but he would fain
persuade me'at the Bector was only ia jest ; and when thikl
wouldn't do, he Bays, " Well, Nancy, you ahouldn^t think so
much about it : Mr. Hat^eld was a little out of humour jnsl
then : you know weVe none of us perfect — even Moees spoke
unadvisedly with his lips. But now sit down a minute, il
you can spare the timer & ^d tell me all your doabts aad

AGNES OBEY
449
'So I sat me down anent him. He was quite a stranger^
you know, Miss Grey, and even y & unger nor Maiater
Hatfield} I believe ; and I had thought him not so pleaeant-
looklng as him, and rather a bit cros^itjh, at > firat, to look at \
but he spake so civit tike— and whea th* cat, poor thing,
jumped on to his knee, he only stroked her, and gave a bit of
a amile : so I thought that was a good sign ; For once, when
she did bo to th'Rector, he knocked her ofT, like as it might
be in acorn and anger, poor thing. But you can't expect a
cat to know manners like a Christian, you know, Miag Grey/
'No ; oi course not, Naucy, But what did Mr, Weston
say then ?'
'He said nought ; but he listened to me as steady an'
patient as could be, an'never a bit o* scorn about him ; so I
went on, an'telled him all, just as IVe teUed you — an'more
too.
'" Well, " says he, " Mr. Hatfield was quite right in
telling you to persevere in doing your duty ; but in advising
you to go to church and attend to the service, and so on, he
didn't mean that was the whole of a Christian's duty ; he
only thought you might there learn what more was to be
done, and be led to take delight in those exercises, instead of
finding them a task and a burden. And if you had asked
him to explain those words that trouble you so much, 1
think he would have told you^ that if many shall seek to
enter in at the strait gate and shall not be able, it is their
own sins that hinder them ; just aa a man with a large ^ack
on his back might wish to pasa through a naiTow doorway,
and find it impossible to do so unless Tie would leave his
Back behind him. But you^ Nancy, I dare say, have no sins
that you would not gladly throw aside, if you knew how ?'*
• ** Indeed, air, you speak truth, " said I.
'" Well, " saya he, " you know the first and great
oommandment — and the second, which Is like unto it— on
which two coromandments hang all the law and the
prophets'? You say you cannot love God ; but it slrikeB me
(hat if you rightly consider who Euid what He isj you cannot
460
AGNES GREY

belp it. He is your father^ your best friead : every
BverythiDg good, pleasaDt, or useful, cornea & om Him ; and
everything evil, everything you have reason to hate, to shoiir
or to fear, comes from Satan — His enemy as well as oois.
And for this cause was God manifest in the fleshy thai He
might destroy the works of the Devil i in one word, God i^
LOVK ; and the more of love we have within us, the nearer
we are to Him and the more of His spirit we possess.'*
'" Well, sir/'I said, *'if I can always think on ibfise
things, I think I might well love God : but how can 1 lofe
my neighbours, when they vex me, & nd be so contrairy and
sinful as some on'em is ? "
'" It may seem a hard matter, " says he, " to love our
neighbours, who have so much of what is evil about Ihem,
and whose faults bo often awaken the evil that lingers witlun
ourselves ; but remember that He made them, and He loftt
them ; and whosoeverr loveth him that begat, loveth him bhfci
is begotten also. And if God so loveth ua, that He gave
Hia only begotten Son to die for us» we ought also to Ion
one another. But if you cannot feel positive affection for
those who do not care for you, you can at least try to do to
them aa you would they should do unto you : you can
endeavour to pity their failings and excuse their offtfuv^
and to do all the good 3^ou can to those about you. AcJ i.'
you accustom yourself to this, Nancy, the very eSbrb ttseli
will make you love them in some degree — to say nothing d
the goodwill your kindneas would beget in them, though
they might have little else that is good about them. If we
love God and wish to serve Him, let ua try to be like Htm,
to do His work, to labour for His glory — which is the gpo4
of man— to hasten the ooming of His kingdom, which iithe
peace and happiness of all the world : however powerless
may seem to be, in doing ail the good ^viecan through lifa
the humblest of us may do much towards it ; and let af "
dwell in love, that He may dwell in us and we in Him. Tb
more happiness we bestow, the more we shall reeeivo, eWJ
here ; and the greater will be our reward in heaT^n vfafia lO

At another time I went to read to a poor labourer who
was in the last stage of consumption. The yonng ladies
had been to Bee him, and somehow a promise of reading hid
been extracted from them; hut it was too much trouble, aa
they begged tiie to do it instead. I went, willingly enough ;
and there too I was gratified with the praises of Mr. Weslon,
both from the sick man and his ^^ife. The former told me
that he derived great comfort and benefit from the vi«iad
the new parson, who frequently came to see him, and wu
* another guess sort of man'to Mr. Hatfield ; who, belon
the other's arrival at Horton, had now and then paid Mm a
visit ; on which occasions he would always insist iqttii
h & ving the cottage-door kept open, to admit the fresh air for
his own convenience, without considering how it might
injure the sufferer ; and having opened his prayer-book aod
hastily read over a part of the Service for the Sick, would
hurry away again : if he did not stay to administer somebarab
rebuke to the afflioted wife, or to make some thougbbieaB, DO*

it is, this winter time. But that'a hia way^ Miaa Grey :
when he cornea into a poor body's house a-seein'aick folk^
he like notices what they most stand i'need on ; an'if he
thinks " they can't reardily get it therseln, he never says nowt
about it, but just gets it (or'ena. An'it isn't everyl > ody " at

I remembered then, with a species of CKultation, that be
had frequently been styled a vulgar brute by the amiable
Miss Murray, because he wore a silver watchj and clothes
not quite so bright and fresh as Mr, Hatiietd's.
In returning to the Lodge I felt very happy, and thanked
God that I had now something to think about ; something to
dwell on as a relief from the weary monotony, the lonely
drudgery, of my present life ; for I ip < w lonely. Never, from
montb to month, from year to year, except during my brief
intervale of rest at home, did I see one creature to whom I
could open my heart, or freely speak my thoughts with any
hope of sympathy, or even comprehension ; never one, unless
H were poor Nancy Brown, with whom I could enjoy a
single moment of real social intercourse, or whose conversa-
sation was calculated to render me better, wiser, or happier
than before ; or who, as far as I could see, could be greatly
benefited by mine. My only companions had been unamiable
children, and ignorant^ wrong-headed girls; from whose
fatiguing folly, unbroken solitude was often a relief mCkst
earnestly desired and dearly prized. But to be i-estricted to
such associates was a serious evil, both in its immediate
effects and the consequences that were likely to ensue*
Never a new idea or stirring thought came to me from with-
out ; and such as rose within me were, for the most part,
miserably crushed at once, or doomed to sickeo or fade
\ because they could not see the light.

assimilaLion cx & ends ; but if one civili & ed man were doonoed
bo pass a dozen years amid a race of intractable savages^
nnlees he had power to improve them, I greatly qne & tkm
whether, at the close of that period, he would not havebeoome,
at least, a haiharian himself. And I* as I could not make my
young companions hotter, feared exceedingly that they wo
make me worae^ — would gradually bring my feelings, habi
capacities, to the level of their own; without, howe?
imparting to me their Ughtheartodness and cheerful vivadty-
Already, 1 seemed to feel my intellect deteriorating, my
heart petrifying, my soul contracting; and I trembled lest
my very moral perceptions should become deadened, my
distinctions of right and wrong ooDfounded, and alJ mybeUer
faculties be sunk, at last, beneath the baneful influence of such
a mode of life. The gross vapours of earth were gathering
around me, and closing in upon my inward heaven ; and thai
it was that Mr. Weston rose at length upon tne, appearing Uke
the morning star in my horizon, to save me from the few of
Utter darkness ; and I rejoiced that I had now a subject for
contemplation that was above me, not beneath. I was glad
to see that all the world was not made up of BIoomfields»
Murrays, Hatfields, Ashbys, ^. ; and that human excellence
wurS not a mere dream of the imagination. When we hear *
jtttle good and no harm of a person, it is easy and pleasant
to imagine more : in short, it is needless to analyse all my
thoughts ; but Sunday was now become a day of peculiaf
delight to me (I was now almost broken-in to the lxw*k
comer in the carriage), for I liked to hear him — and I liked
to see him, too ; though I knew he was not handsome, or
even what ia called agreeable, in outward aspect; but.
certainly, he was not ugly.

In stature he was a little, a very little, a^bove the middle
size ; the outline of his face would be pronounced too equ & re
for beauty, but to me it announced decision of character ; his
dark brown hair was not carefully curled, like Mr. Hatfield's,
but simply brushed aside over a broad white forehead ; the
e3'ebrows, I aupposs, were too projecting, but Irom uader
those dark bmws there gleamed an eye of singular power,
brown in colouPj not large, and Bomewhat deep-set, but
Btrikingly briUiant, and full of expression ; there was
characteiTf too, in the mouth, something that bespoke a man
of firm purpose and an habitual thinker ; and when he
smiled — but I will not speak of that yet, for, at the time I
mention, I bad never sci^n him smile : and, indeed, his
general appearance did not impress me with the idea of a
man given to such a relaxation, nor of such an individual
as the cottagem described htm. I had early formed my
opinion of him ; and, in spite of Miaa Murray's objurgations,
was fully convinced that he was a man of strong senee, firm
faith, and ardent piety, but thoughtful and stem : and when
I found that, to hia other good qualities, Vf & s added that of
true benevolence and gentle, considerate kindness, the dis*
oovery, perhaps, delighted me the more, as I had not bden
prepared to expect it.
CHAPTER Xn
THE SEOWEB
The Dexi visit I paid tc Nuicy BrowD wag to the seoood
^eek in Mattch : for, though I had many spare minutei
dui-ing the dfiy, I seldom could look upon an hour la
entirely my own ; sincCp where everj'tfaing was left to tb«
capricGB of Misa Matilda and her aisteF^ there could be no
order or regularity. Whatever oocupalaon I chose, when
Dot actuEbUy busied about them or their concerns, I had, u
it were^ to keep my loine girded, my ehoes on my feet, wai
rny staff in my hand ; for not to be immodiately forihcotniiig
when called for, waa regarded as a grave and inexcasablfl
offence : not only by my pupils and their mother, but by th«
very servant, who came in breathless haste to call me,
esclaiming,'You're to go to the Bchoolroom directly, muiB,
the young ladies is WAmNO 1 1'Climas of horror ! aotually
waiting for their governess 1 M
But this time I was pretty sure of an hour or two to
myself ; for Matilda was preparing for a long ride, and
Rosalie was dressing for a dinner-party at Lady Aahby's : w
I book the opportonity of repairing to the widow's cotta^
where I found her in some anxiety about her cat, which hid
been absent all day. I comforted her with as tnuy
anecdotes of that animal's roving propensitiea a & I oould
recollect.'I'm feai^d o'th'gamekeepers/ said she ^'thal'l
aU at I think on. If th'j^onng gentleoaen had been at hooMi

rere better, but still far from v^eM : ahe bad been trying to
[e a Sunday shirt for liei'sou, but told me she could only
,r to do a Uitle bit at it now and then, & 0 that it progressed
it slowly, though the poor lad wanted it aadly. So I pro-
nged to help her a little^ after I had read to her, for I had
lenty of time that evenings and need not return till duak.
le thankfully ac < 3epted the offer. * Ad'you'll be a bit o*
impany for nte too, MiBS,'said she ;'I like as I feel lone-
»me without my cat/ But when I had finished reading,
td done the half of a seam, with Nancy's capacious brass
limble fitted on to my finger by means of a roll of paper, I
disturbed by the entrantse of Mr. Wt^ton, vsnth the

urns.
'Take care of it/ said he,'and don't let it go near the
rabbit-warren, for the gamekeeper swears he'll shoot it if he
sees it there again : he would have done so to-day, if I b & d
not been in time to stop him. I believe it is raining. Miss
Grey/ added he, more quietly, observing that I had put aside
my work, and was preparing to depart. * Don't let me
disturb you— I shan't stay two rainutes/
* You'll both stay while this shower gets owered,'said
Nancy, as she stirred the fire, and placed another chair
_besid6 it; *what t there's room for all/
I can see better here, thank you, Nancy/ replied I,
kfcing my work to the window, where she had the goodneaa
suffer me to remain unmolested, while she got a brush to

remove the cat's hair^ from Mr. Weston's coat, cftrefoUy
wip^ct tho re.in from hig hatj and gave thd cat its fiopper,
busily talkiDg all the time : now thanking her clerical faiffliJ
for what he had done ; now wondering how the cat Imd
found out the warren ; and now lamenting the grohaWe
consequences of such a diaoovery. He listened with a quiets
good-natured smile, and at length took a seat in compliance
with her pressing invitations, but repeated that he did not
mean to stay.
'I have another place to go to/ said he, *and T see*

'No, thank you, Nancy, I'm quite warm, I must go is

^ Oh, Miss! You said you could stop while dusk!'
cried the provoking old woman, and Mr. Weston seized his
hat.
*Nay, sir/ exclaimed she >'pray don*t go now, while i1
rains so fast.*
'But it strikes me I'm keeping your visitor away frauD
the fire.'
* No, you're not, Mr. Weston,* replied I, hoping then
was no harm in a falsehood of that description.
* No, fiuxe I'cried Nancy.'What, there's lots o* mom!'
* Miss Grey/ said he, half jestingly, a & if he fell it
neoessary to change the present subject, whether he hiA
anything particular to say or not, * I wish you would make
my peace with the squire, when you see him. He wm by
when I rescued Nancy's cat, and did not quite approve ol
the deed. I told him I thought he might better spaiQ all hit

treated me to some rather Tmgentlemanly language ; aod I

e^ded,'But never mind ; I imagine the squire has more to

I went on with my sewing as long a3 T could see, and
then hade Nanoy good-evening ; checking her too lively
gratitude by the undeniable assurance that I had only done
for her what she would have done for me, if she had been in
my place and I in hers, I hastened back to Horton Lodge,
where, having entered the school-room, I found the tea-table
all in confu^on, the tray flooded with slopa^ and Miga
Matilda in a most feroctous humour.
'Mias Grey, whatever have you been about ? I've had
tea half an hour ago, and had to make it myself, and drink
it all alone 1 I wish you would come in sooner I *
'I've been to see Nancy Brown. I thought you would
not be back from your ride/
'How could I ride in the rain, I should like to know.
That damned pelting shower was vexatious enough^omiug
on when I was just in full swing ; and then to come and
& nd nobody in to tea I and you know I can't make the teaai
I like it.'
I didn't think of the shower/ replied I (and, indeed,
160
AGNES GREY
the thought of its driving her home bad never entered mj
head),
'No, of course ; you were under shelter yourself, ami
you never thought of other people/
I bore her Goarse reproaches with astonishing equardmiJj,
even with cheerfulness ; for I was sensible that I had doce
more good to Nfiney Brown than harm to her : and perh & p9
some other thoughts asBiBted to keep up niy spirits, ftod
impart a relish to the cup of cold, overdrawn tea, and t
charm bo the otherwise unsightly table ; and — I had alniosl
said— ^to Miss Matilda's unamiable faoe. But she boon
betook herself to the stables, and left me to the ^uiet enjoy-
ment of my BOlitai^ meal.
CHAPTER Xm
THE FBIMBOBES
Miss Mubbat now alw & ys went twice to churchy for she ao
loved admiration th & t she could not bear to lose a aingte
opportunity of obtaining it; and ahe was so sure of it
wherever she showed herseU, that, whether Harry Meltham
and Mr. Green were (here or not» there was certain to be
somebody present who would not be insensible to her charms^
besides the Beotor, whose official capacity generally obliged
him to attend. Usually, ako, if the weather permitted, both
she and her sister would walk home ; Matilda, because she
hated the continement of the carriage ; ahe, because she dis-
liked the privacy of it, and enjoyed the company that gene-
rally enlivened the first mile of the journey in walking from
the church to Mr. Green's park-gates: near which com-
menced the private road to Horton Lodge, which lay in the
opposite directionj while the highway conducted in a straight-
forward course to the still more distant mansion of Sir Hugh
Meltham, Thus there was always a chance of being
accompanied, so lar^either by Harry Meltham, with or without
Miaa Meltham, or Mr. Green, with perhaps one or both of hia
sisters, and any gentlemen visitors they might have.
Whether I walked with the young ladies or rod© with
their parents, depended upon their own capricious will : it
they chose to'take'me. I went ; if, for reasons best known
bo ^emselves, they chose to go alone, I took my seat in the
carriage. I liked walking better, but a sense of reluctance
tp obtrude my presence on anyone who did not desire i^

im
AGNES GREY

always kept me passive on thd & e and similar occodoos ; ind
I never iaquiired into the causes of their vaj-3^g whitiii
Indeed, this was the best policy — for to aubmit and obligs
was the governess's part, to consult their own pleasure wae
th£it oC the pupils. But when I did walK t^o ^^^ h & U of
journey was generally a great nuisance to me. As nOQe of
the before-mentioned ladles and gentlemen ever noticed me,
it was disagreeable to walk beside them, as if listening to
what they saidj or wishing to be thought one of them, while
they talked over me, or across ; and if their eyes, in speaking,
chanced to fall on me, it seemed as if they looked on vacanej
■ — Ebs if they either did not see me, or were very defiirooa to
mEkke it appear so. It was disagreeable, too, to walk beM & d^
and thus appear to acknowledge my own inferiority ; for. In
truth, I considered myself pretty nearly as good as the best
of them, and wished them to know that I did so» and not to
imagine that I looked upon myself as a mere domestic, who
knew hi^r own place too well to walk b«side sach fine ladies
and gentlemen as they were — though her young ladies migbt
choose to have her with them, and even condescend to oou'
verse with her when no better company wer« at hand.
Thus — I am almost ashamed to confess it— but indeed I
gave myself no little trouble in my endeavours (if I did kt^p
up with them) to appear perfectly unconscious or regiirdleas
of their presence, as if I were wholly absorbed in my own
reflections, or the contemplation of surrounding objectft ; or»
if I lingered behind, it was some bird or insect, some tree Of
flower, that attracted my attention, and having duly ex-
amined that, I would pursue my walk alone^ at a leisurely
pace, until my pupils had bidden adieu to their oompanioni
and turned off into the quiet private road.
One such occasion I particularly well remember; it was &
lovely afternoon about the close of March ; Mr. Groen and
his sisters had sent their carnage back empty^ in order to
enjoy the bright sunshine and balmy air in a stv^ble walk
home along with their visitors, Captain Somebody atui
Lieutenant Somebody-else (a couple of military Cope), twl

AGNES GREY
468
the MiBses Murray, who, of csourae^ contrived to join them.
Such a party was highly agreeable to Rosalie ; but not
finding it equB.lly suitable to my kiBte, I presently fell back,
aiid began to botanise and entomologi & e along the green
banks and budding h & dges, till the company was considerably
in advance of me, and I could bear the sweet song of the
happy lark ; then my apirit of mi & anthropy began to melt
away beneath the soft, pure air and genial sunshine ; but aad
thoughts of early childhood, and yeai^ningB for departed joys,
or lor a brighter future lot, arose instead. As my eyes
wandered over the steep banks covered with young grass and
green-leaved plants, and surmounted by budding hedges, I
longed intensely for some l & miliar flower that might recaU
the woody dales or green hill-sides of home : the brown
nsoorlands, of course, were out of the question. Such a dis-
covery would make my eyes gush out with water, no doubt ;
but that wa3 one of my greatest enjoyments now. At
length 1 descried, high up between the tv^iated roots of an
oak, three lovely primrosea, peeping so sweetly from their
hiding-place that the tears already started at the sight ; but
they grew so high above me > that I tried in vain to gather
one or two, to dream over and to carry with me'. I could not
reach them unless I climbed the bank, which I was deterred
from doing by hearing a footstep at that moment beliind me,
and was, therefore^ about to turn away, when I was startled
by the words,'Allow me to gather them for you, Miss Grey,*
spoken in the grave, low tones of a well-known voice. Im*
mediately the flowers were gathered, and in my hand. It
was Mi\ Weston, of course — who else would trouble himself
to do fio much for rtie i
* I thanked him ; whether warmly or coldly, I cannot tell :
but certain I tim that I did not express half the gratitude I
felt. It was foolish, perhaps, to feel any gratitude at all ;
but it seemed to me, at that moment, as if this were a remajk-
afale instance of his good-nature : an act of kindness which I
could not repay, hut never should forget : so utterly
unaccustomed was I to receive such civilities, so little
^4
AGNES GREY
prepared to expect theni Eroni anyone within fifty mi!
HortOD Lodge. Yet this did not prevent me from ffifiliiig a
little uncomfortable in his presence ; and I proceeded to
follow my pupils at a much quicker pace than before ;
though, perhaps, if Mr. Weston had taken the hint, and lei
rae pass without another word, I might hare repented it an
hour after : but he did not. A somewhat rapid walk for me
was but an ordinary pace for him,
'Your young ladies have left you alone/ s & id he.
'Yes, they are occupied with more agreeable company/
'Then don't trouble yourself to overtake them.'
I slackened my pace ; but next moment regretted havin^;
done ao ; my companion did not speak ; and I had nothing
in the world to say, and feared he might be in the sum
predicament. At lengtli, however^ he broke the pause by
askings with a certain quiet abruptneBs peculiar to himself, if
I Uked flowers.
* Yes i very much/ I answered/'wild-flower» especially.'
'I like wild-fiowers/ said he ;'others I don't care abo\it»
because I have no particular associations connected witb
them — except one or two. What are your favourite flowers ?
'PrimrosBB, blue-bellSj and heath blossoms/
* Not violets 7'
* No ; because, as you sayj I have no particular associAtioBS
connected with them ; for there are no sweet violets among
the hills and valleys round my home/
* It must be a great consolation to you to have a home,
Misa Grey/ observed my companion after a short pause.
* however remote, or however seldom visited, atill li is
something to look to/
* It is so much that I think I could not Eve without it,'
replied I, with an enthuslaeni of which I immedia^ly
repented ; for I thought it must have sounded essentiallj
silly.
'Oh, yes, you could/ said he, with a thoughtful smiU
'The ties that bind us to Ufe are tougher than you imagioe,
or than anyone can who has not felt how roughly they mftj

be puUod without breaking. You might be miserable
without a home, but even you could live ; and not so
Eniserably b & you suppose. The human he & rt is like India-
rubber ; o. little swells it, but a great deal will not bur & t it.
If'* little more than nothing will disturb it, little less than all
things will suflSce *'to break it. As in the outer members o!
our frame^ there ib a vital power inherent in itself that
strengthens It agaluBt external violence. Every blow th & t
shakes it will serve to harden it against a future stroke ; a^B
constant labour thickens the sldn of the hand, and strengthena
its mu & cles instead of wasting thgm away : so that a day of
arduous toil) that might excoriate a l & dy's palm, would make
no sensible impression on that of a hardy ploughman.
'I speak from experience — partly my own. Th©r« was &
Ume when I thought as you do — at leasts I was fuUy
persuaded that home and ibB afifectiona were the only thin^
that made life tolerable : that, if deprived of these, existence
would become a burden hard to be endured ; but now I have
no home — unless you would dignify my two hired rooms at
Morton by & uch a name ;~and not twelve months ago I lost
the last and dearest of my early friends l and yet, not only I
Eve, but I am not wholly destitute of hope and comfort, even
for this life : though I must acknowledge that I can seldom
enter even an humble cottage at the close of day, and see ita
inhabitants peaceably gathered around their cheerful hearth,
without a feeling almost of envy at their domestic enjoyment.'
'You don't know what happiness Hes before you yet,'
said I : • you are now only in the commencement of your
journey/
'The beat of happiness/ replied he,'is mine already — the
power and the will to be useful.'
We now approached a stile commanicating with a foot-
path that conducted to a farm-house, where, I suppose, Mr,
Weston purposed to make himself'useful ; * for he presently
took leave of me, crossed the stile, and traversed the path
with his usual firm, elastic tread, lea\ing me to ponder his
rords as I continued my course alonei I had heard before
466
AGNES GREY
that lie had lost hia mother not many months l > efore R*
Dame^ She then was the last and dearcat of bis early fnends ;
and he had no home. I pitied him from my heart : I almost
wept for eytnpathy. And this, I thought, aocomited fe
the shade of pretnuture thoughtfulne^ that so freq^iecttf
clouded his hrow^ and obtained for him the reputation of ft
moroso and sullen disposition with the charitable Mess
Murray and all her kin,'But,* thought I,'he ia not *o

an actdre life ; and [w wide field for u^ful exertion lies before

grant the partner of that home may be worthy of his chcioa
and make it a happy one^^uoh a homo as be deserves to

matter what I thought.
I began thia book with the intention of oono^Ii & K

^perusing a fellow -creature's heart i but we have somA thoogh*

By this time the Greens had takea themselTes totboi,
own abodof and the Murrays had turned down the pri;
roadf whither I hastened to follow them, I fonnd the
girla warm in an animated diBcussion on the Fospoctiveisflrife^

In the middle of a Bentence to e^claimp with malicious glae—

'Now, oome» Miss Murray^ don't be foolish/ said
attompting a good-natured laugh ; * you know suoh noi

But she still went on talking such intolerable sttttf— h*

^^P'In Nancy's cottage/
i'Ah-ha ! youVe met him there, have you?'exclaimed
I Boaalief with exultant laughter,'Ah t now, Matilda, IVe

^H Bhe goes there to flirt with Mr. Weaton/
^B'Beally, that is not worth contradicting — I only saw him

Irritated as I woe at their foolish mirth and vexatious
imputations, the uneasiness did not continue long : when
they had had their laugh out^ they relumed again to the
captain and lieutenant ; and, while they disputed and
commentiBd upon them, my indignation rapidly cooled ; the
cause of it waa quickly forgottenp and I turned my thoughts
into a pleasanter cbanneL Thus we proceeded up tha park^
and entered tha hall ; and as I ascended the stairs to my
own chamber, I had but one thought within me : my heart
was filled to ovetflowing with one single earnest wish.
Having entered the room, and shut the door, I fell upon my
knees and offered up a fervent but not impetuous prayer :
'Thy will be done,'I strove to say throughout ; but,'Father,
ftll ihings are possible vfiih Thee, and may it be Thy will/
waa sure to follow. That wish — that prayer^both men
and women would have scorned me for—'But, Father,
Thtnt wilt not despise !'J said, and felt that it was true. It
seemed to me that another's welfare was at least as ardeutly
implored for as my own ; nay, even tfuit was the principal
object of my heart's desire. I might have been deceiving
myself ; but that idea gave me couBdence to ask, and power

468
AGNBS GBET
to hope I did not ask in vain. As for the primroses, I kapt
two of them in a glasa in my room until they were oompletely

CHAPTER XIV
THB B.ECTOR
The following d & y was as fine as the preceding one* Soon
after breakfast Miss Matilda^ having galloped and blundered
through a few unprofitable lessona^ and vengeably thumped
ihe piano for an hour, in a terrible humour with both me and
itj because her mamma would not give her a hoLday^ had
betaken herself to her favourite places of resortp the yards,
the stables, and the dog-kennels ; and Mias Murray was
gone forth to enjoy a quiet ramble with a new fashionable
covel for her companicn, leaving me in the BchcMDhoom hard
at work upon a w & ter-colour drawing which I had promised
to do for her, and whioh she insisted upon my finishing that
day-
At tny feet lay a little rough terrier. It was the property
of Miss Matilda ; but she hated the animal, and intended to
BeU it^ alleging that it was quite spoiled. It w & s really an
excellent dog of its kind ; but she aMrmed it woa fit for
nothingp and had not even the sense to know its own
EnistresB.
The fact was she had purchased it when but a small
puppy, insisting at first that no one should touch it but her-
self ] but soon heooming tired of so helpless and troublesome
a nursling, she had gladly yielded to my entreaties to be
allow^ to take charge of it ; and I, by carefully nursing the
little creature from infancy to adolescence^ of courBe, had
obtained its afTections : a reward I should have greatly
valued, and looked upou as tar outweighing all the trouble I

had bad ^ih it, bad not poor Saap*s gr & tefnl feelings
exposed him to many a harsh word and many aspit^ul kick
and pinch from his owner, and were ho not now in dtkngerof
being'put away * in consequence, or transferred to some
rough, Btoijy-hearted master. But how could I help it? 1
could not make the dog hate me by cruel treatment, and ^
she would not propitiate Kim by kindness. I
However, while I thua Bat^ working away witli my pencil,'
Mrs. Murray came, half-sailing, half-busthng* iuto ihe room.
* Miss Grey,'ghe began, —'dear ! how can you sit at yoor
drawing such a day as this ? * (She thought I was doing it
for my own pleasure.) I wonder you don't put on yom
bonnet and go out with the young ladies.'
^ I think, ma'am, Miss Murray is reading ; and Mioi
Matilda is amusing herself with her dogs.*
'If you would try to amuse Miss Matilda yourself a Httk
more, I think she would not be driven to seek amuseincacil
in the companionship of dogs and horses and grooms, bo
much as she is ; and if yon would be a little more cheerfol
and oonversabld with Miss Murray, she would not so often
go wandenEig in the fields with a book in her hand. How-
ever, I don*t want to vex you,* added abe, seeing, I suppose,
that my cheeks burned and my band trembled with aom^
tinamiable emotion.'Do, pray, try not to be ao touchy
— there's no speaking to you else. And tell rae if you know
where Rosalie is gone : aud why she likes to be ao moch
alone?*
'She aaya she likes to be alone when she has a new book
to read/
'But why can't she read it in the park or the gardeo ?
— why should she go into the fields and lanes ? And how ii
it that that Mr, Hatfield so often finda her out? She told ine
last week he'd walked his horse by her side all up Mofli
Lane ; and now I'm sure it was he I saw, from my dreasing-
room window, walking so briskly past the park-gatea.and on
towards the field where she so frequently goes. I wish ytm
would go and see if she is there : and jva% genUy r^nind

h & t that it 13 not proper for b. young lady of her rank and
pro & peote to be wo^ndaring about by herself in that manner,
exposed to the attentions of anyotie that presumes to address
her ; like 8ome poor neglected girl that has no park to walk
in, and no friends to take care of her : and tell her that her
papa would be extremely angry if he knew of her treating
Mr. Hatfield in the faroiliar manner that I feao'she does ;
and— oh t if you — if any governess had but half a mother's
watchfulness — half a mother's anxious care, I should be
saved tihis trouble ; and you would see at once the necessity
of keeping your eye upon her, and making your company
agreeable to Well, go — go ; there's no time to be lost/
cried she, seeing that I had put away my drav.ing materials,
and was waiting in the doorway for the conclusion of heir
address.
Aocording to her prognostications, I found Mias Murray in
her favourite field just without the park ; and, unfortunately,
not alone ; for the tall» stately figure of Mr. Hatfield waa
Blowly saunteriog by her side.
Here was a poeer for me. It was my duty to interrupt
the Ute-^'Ute: but how waa it to be done? Mr. Hatfield
oould not to be driven away by so insignificant a pereon as
I ; and to go and place myself on the other side of Miss
Murray, and intrude my unwelcome presence upon her with-
out noticing her oompanion, was a piece of rudeness I could
not be guilty of : neither had I the coui-age to cry aloud from
the top of the field that she was wanted elsewhere. So I
took the intermediate course of walking slowly but steadily
towards them ; resolving, if my approach failed to scare away
the beau» to pass by and tell Miss Murray her mamma
wanted hen
She certainly looked very ohEurming as Bhe strolled,
lingering along under the budding horaa-ohestnut trees that
Btretched their long arms over the park-palinga ; with her
closed book in one hand, and in the other a graceful sprig of
myrtle, which served her as a very pretty plaything ; her
472
AGNES OBEY
gently stirred by the faree^B, her fair chedk flashed with
gratified vanity^ her smiling blue eyes, now slyly glancing
towards her admirer^ now gazing downward at her myrda
sprig. But Snap, running before me, interrupted her in the
midst of some half-pert^ half-playful repartee^ by catching
hold of her dress and vehemently tugging thereat ; till Mr.
Hatfield, with hie cane, administered a resounding thwack
upon the auimal'a skull, and sent it yelping back to me with
a clamoroufi outcry that afiforded the reverend gentleman
great amusement : but seeing me so near, he thought, I
auppos6p he might as well be taking his departure ; and, as
I stooped to oaress the dog, with ostentatious pity to show my
disapproval of his severity^ I heard him say : * When shall
I see you again, Miss Murray ?'
'At church, I suppose,'replied she, * unless your business
chances to bring you here again at the precise moment when
I happen to be walldng by/
'r could always manage to have business here, if I knew
precisely wheu and where to find you.'
'But if I would, I could not inform you, for I am bo
immethodicaly I never can bell to-day what I shall do to-
morrow/
'Then give me that, meantime, to comfort me/ said he,
half jestingly and half in earnesti extending his hand for ih &
sprig of myrtle.
'No, indeed, I shan't/
'Do I pra^ do ! I shall be the most miserable of meo If
you don't. You cannot be so cruel as to deny me a lavoor
flo easily granted and yet so highly prised 1'pleaded he as
ardently as if his life depended on it <
By this time I stood within a very few yards of tham,
impatiently waiting his departure.
* There then ! take it and go/ said Rosalie,
He joyfully received the gift, murmured something tliat
made her blush and toss her head, but with a Uttle laugh that
showed her displeasure was entirely afTected ; and then with
a courteous salutation withdrew.

might B^cknowledge ; but never for one like poor Mr > Hatfield,
who has not seven hundred a year to bless himself with. I
like to talk to him, because he*B so clever and amusing — I
wish Sir Thomas Aahby were half as nice ; besideSf I must
have somebody to flirt with, and no one else has the sense to
come here ; and when we go out, mamma won't let me flirt
with anybody but Sir Thomas — if he*a there ; and if he's Tiot
there, I^m bound hand and foot, for fear somebody should go

'Is it reaLl]^ bo. Miss Murray ? and does your roanprr'*
know it, and yet wish you to naarry him ?'
'To be sure, she does I She knows more against him

tihoaghta from cno. She talked no more to me about the
Hector; but I could see tli & t hat mind, if not her hcfirtj wa^
fixed upon him stilly aod that she vras intent upon obtaining
another interview: for though^ in compliance with her
mother's request^ I was bow constituted the companion of her
rambles for a time^ abo still persisted in wandeHng in the
fields and lanes that lay in ihe nearest proximity to the road;
and, whether aho talked to me or read the hook ahe carried in
her hand, she kept continually pausing to look round her, or
gaze up the road to see if anyone wag coming; and if a
horseman trotted by > I could tell by her unqualified abuse of
the poor equestrian, whoever he might bo, that she hated
him because he was not Mr. Hatfield.
* Surely,'thought I, * she is not so indifferent to him aa
e believes herself to be, or would have others to believe
her; and her mother's anxiety is not so wholly causeless
as she affirms.'
Three days passed away, and he did not make his
appearance. On the afternoon of the fourth, as we were
walking beside the park-palinga in the memorable field, each
furnished with a book (for I always took care to provide
myself with something to be doing when she did not requiro
me to talk), she suddenly interrupted my studies by ex-
claiming—
Oh, Miss Grey t do be so kind as to go and see Mark
ood, and take his wife half-a-crown from me— I should
have given or sent it a week ago, but quite forgot. There I *
said she, throwing me her purse, and speaking very fast—
'Never mind getting it out now, but take the purse and give
them what you like ; I would go with you, but I want to
finish this volume. I'll come and meet you when I've dona
it. Be quick, will you— and — oh, wait; hadn't you better
read to him a bit ? Hun to the house and get some sort of
a good book. Anything will do/
I did as I was desired ; but, suspecting something from
her hurried manner and the suddenness of the request, I
just glanced back before I quitted the field, and there was

Mr. Hatfield about to enter at the gate below. Bj leDdbg

yards before I encountered Mr. Weaton, apparently on hU

the sick man and his family, and ^-ith a sort of aooonsdou^
brotherly disregard to ceremony took from my hand the book

a few brief but very sensible remarks, and restored it ; ^len

While I waa walking aloDg, happy within, and pleased

that she, tooj was happy, In her own way. Bunning up to
me, ehe put har arm through minB} and without waiting to
recover breath, begEtn —'Now, Miss Grey, think yoursell

which quelled all hope at once. Oh, if you had seen how

'It was a great lie, hut he looked so confident in his own^

'" Then it's all over, I suppoie, " he said, looking as if ha
could have died on the spot with vexation and the intensity
of his despair. But he was angry as well as disappointed.
There was he, suffering so unspeakably, and there was I, the
pitiless cause of it all, so utterly impenetrable to all the

CHAPTER XV
THE WALK
OHj dear ! I wisfa Hatfield had not been bo procipit & tc 1
said RoBalie next day at four p.m., as, with & portentous yawn,
she laid down her worsted-work iLrid looked Ustlos & ly towards
the window.'There's no inducement to go out now; and
nothing to look forward to. The days will be so long and
dull wheti there are no parties to enliven thero ; and there
are none this week, or next either, that I know of.'
•Pity you were bo cross to him/ observed Matilda, to
whom this lamentation was addressed, * Hell never come
again : and I aufipect you liked him after all. I hoped you
would haTe taken him for your beau, and left dear Harry to
me.'
* Humph ! my beau toust be aa Adonis indeed, Matilda,
the adjnired of all beholders, if I am to be contented with
him alone. I'm aon7 to lose IIatfield» I confe & e ; but the
first decent man, or number of tnen, that come to supply his
place, wiU bo more than welcome. It's Sunday to-nionow — -
J do wonder how hell look, and wEiether he'll be able to go
through the BGrvioc. Most likely he'll pretend be'b got a ooldj
and make Mr. Weston do it all.'
'Not he I'exclaimed Matilda, somewhat contemptuously.
/ Fool as he is, he's not so Boft as that comes to/
Her sister was slightly offended ; but the event proved
'atilda was right: the disappointed lover performed his
itor^ duties as usual. Bosaliei indeedj a & m & d he looked

very p & U & nd dejected : he might he & little p & Ier ; but
difTerenca, if & ny, was scarcely perceptible. As for his
dejectioQj I oertaiDly did not hear hia laugh noging from ilie
vestry as usual, nor his voice loud in hilarious diacour^ ;
though I did hear it uplifted in rating the sexton in a
maQH & r that made the congregation stare ; and, in his transits
to and fi'om the pulpit and the commumon-tahlei there
was more of solemn pomp, and less of that irreverent, self-
coafident, or rather self -delighted imperiousnees with whiclj
he UBually swept along — that air that seemed to say,'Yoti
all reverence and adore me, I know ; but if anyone does not,
I defy him to the teeth I'But the m08t remarkable change
waSj thai he never once suETered his eyes to wander in tba
djjr^ction of Mr. Murray's pow» and did not leave the cban:h
till we were gone.
Mr. Hatfield had doubtless roceived a very severe blow ;
but his pride impeUed him to use every eGton to conceal the
effects of ib. He had been disappointed in his certain hope
of obtaining not only a beautiful, and, to him, highly attnui-
tiva wife, but one whose rank and fortune might give bril-
liance to far inferior charms : he was likewise, no doabt»
intensely mortified by his repulse, and deeply offended at
the conduct of Miss Murray throughout. It would havs
given him no little consolation to have known how disap-
pointed she was to find him apparently so little moved, and
to see that he was able to refrain from casting a single glance
at her throughout both services ; though, she declared, it
showed he was thinking of her all the time, or his eyes woold
have fallen upon her, if it were only by ohanoe : but if they
had so chanced to fall, she would have affirmed it was because
they could not resist the attraction. It might have pleased
him, too, in some degree^ to have seen how dull and dissatisfied
she was throughout that week (the greater part of it, at least),
for IcMjk of her usual source of exoitement ; and how often
she regretted having'u & ed him up bo soon,'like a child (bat,
having devoured iL^ plumcake too hastily^ aits auokiiig ita
fingers, and vainly Isyiienting its greedinoBS.

At length I w & s called upon^ one fine morDing, to accom-
pany her in & walk to the village^ Ostensibly sha went to
get some Bha4es of Berlin wool^ at a tolarably respectable
fihop that was chiefly supported by the ladies of the vicinity :
really— I trust there ia qo breach of charity in supposing that
she went with the idea of meeting either with the Rector
IiimseUr or some other admiret by the w & y ; for as we went
& loQg, sho kept wondering'what Hatfield would do or say,
if we met him/ & o. & c. ; as we passed Mr. Green's park-
gatoB, she * wondered whether he was at home— great stupid
blockhead'; aa Lady Melthani's carriage passed ua, she
* wondered what Mr. Harry was doing this fine day'; and
then began to abuse his elder brother for being * such a fool
as to get married and go and live in London/
'Why/ aaid I^'I thought you wanted to live in London
yourself.'
'Yes, because it's so dull here: but then he makes it still
duller by taking himself off : and if he were not manied I
might have him instead of tliat odious Sir Thomas/
Then, observing the prints of a horse's feet on the
somewhat miry road, she'wondered whether it was a
gentleman's horse/ and finally concluded it was, for the
impresaions were too Bmo^Il to have been made by a * great
clumsy cart-horse * ; and then she * wondered who the rider
could be/ and whether we should meet him coming back^ for
fihe was sure he had only passed that morning ; and lastly,
when we entered the village and saw only a few of its humble
inhabitants moving about» she * wondered why the stupid
people couldn*t keep in their houses ; she was sure she
didn't want to see their ugly faces, and dirty, vulgar clothes
— it wasn't for that she came to Horton 1'
Amid all this, I confess, I wondered, too, in secret,
whether we should meet, or catch a glimpse of somebody
else ; and as we passed his lodgings, I even went so far as to
wonder whether he was at the window. On entering the
Bhop, Miss Murray desired me to stand in the doorway while
sha transacted her business, and tell her if anyone paBBed«

than nothing.'
She greeted them, however, with a cheerful smjjo, and
protestations of pleasure at the happy meeting equal to their
own^ They placed themselves one on each aide of her, and
all three walked away chatting and laughij^g as young i & die«

Miss Buean like one doEif and dumb, who ooold Doither

But this time I was not long alone. It struck me, at
first, aa very odd, that just as I was thinking about Mr.
Weston he should come up and accost me ; but afterwards,
on due reflection, I thought there was nothing odd about it,
unless it were the fEbct of his speaking to me ; for on such «
morning and so near his own abode, it was natural enough
that he should be about ; and as for my thinking of him, I hftd
been doing fchatf with little intermission, ever since we set oul
on our journey ; so there was nothing remarkable in that

'No, but 1 never made one yet ; and in my present

light frnd trivial, it was amuBing, and ehe was never at alosa
for something to say, or for suitable words to expreas it in.
There was nothrng pert or flippant in her manner now, aa
when she walked viith Mr. Hatfield ; there was only a gentle,
playful kind of vivacity, which I thought must he peculiarly
pleasing to a man of Mn Weston's disposition and tempera-

CHAPTEB XVT
THE SUB8TIT0TI0N
Next Sunday was one of the gloomiest; of April days — a day
of thick, da*rk olouds, ai^d heavy showers. None of the
Murrays were disposed to attend church in the afternoon,
excepting Rosalie : she was heot upon going as usual ; bo
she ordered the carriage, and I went with her : nothing loth,
of course^ for at church I might look without fear of scorn or
censure upon a form and fa^a more pleasing to me than the
most beautiful of God'a creations ; I might listen without
diaturbance to a voice more charming than the sweetest
music to my ears ; I tnight seem to hold communion with
that soul in wliich I felt so deeply interested, and imbibe ita
purest thoughts and holiest aspirations, with no alloy to
fluch felicity except the sacret reproaches of my conscience^
" which would too often whiaper that I was deceiving my owu
self, and mocking God with the service of a heart more bent
upon the creature than the Creator.
Sometimes such thoughts would give me trouble enough ;
but sometimes I could quiet them with thinking— it is not
the mun, it is bia goodness that I love.'Whatsoever things
are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things
are honest and of good report, think on these things/ We
do well to worship God in His works ; and I know none of
them in which BO nia,ny of His attributes— so much of Hia
owu spirit shines, as in this His faithful servant ; whom to
know and not to appreciate, were obtuse InsenaibiUty in me,
who have ao little else to occupy my heart.

Almost immecliabely after khe oonclaraon of fche Servian
MisB Murray left the ohuroh. We had to stand b tb
porch, for h wae raining, and the carriage was not jet aotat
I wondered at her coming forth bo hastilyj for neither ytwa^
Meltham nor Squire Green waa there ; but I soon foond ii
was to secure an interview with Mr. Weston as he came oat,
which he presentily did. Having saluted us both, he would
have paafidd on, but she detained him ; first with obserw
dona upon the disagreeable weather, and then with askm^
if he would bo & o kind as to come eome tinie to-momow u

Weston ? The old woman will hke to know when to espool

cottages in order when decent people come to see them thaa
we are apt to suppose.'
Here was a wonderful inatance of consideradon from Uie
thoughtless Miaa Murray. Mr, Weston named an hour la
the morning at which ho would endeavour to be there. Bt
this time the carriage was ready, and the footman w & i
waiting, with an open umbrella, to escort Miss Muiriy
through the churciiyard. I was about to follow ; but Mr.
Weston had an umbrella too. and o£r6i*ed me the benefit < i
lbs shelter, for iL was raining heavily.
'No, thank you, I don't mind the rain,* I s^d. I almp
l^bcked common sense when taken by surprise*
'But you don't Itke it, I suppose? — an ombretla will d >
you no harm at any rate,'he replied^ with a smile thil
showed he was not offended ; as a man of worse temper or
less penetration would have been at such a refusal of bis anL^
I could not deny the truth of his assertion, and so went wit
him to the carnage ; he even offered me his hand on getttof'

for fear of giving offence. One glance he gave, one littb

'I would have sent the footman hack for you^ Misfi Gr & y,
if you'd waited a moment — you needn't have taken Mr.
Weston's umbrella,'observed BoaaJie, vnth s, very unamiaible
cloud Qpon her pretty face.
'I would have come without an umbrella, but Mr. Weston
offered me the benefit of his, and I could not have refused
it more than I did without olTending him/ replied I, ejniUng
placidly ; for my inward happiness made that amusing,
which would have wounded me at another time.
The carriage was now in motion* Misa Murray bent
forwards, and looked out of the window as we were passing
Mr. Westou. He was pacing homewards D.Iong the causeway,

I made no answer. I saw she waa out of humour, and I
derived a secret gratification from the fact, not that she was
vexed, but that she thought she had reason to be so. It
Knade me think my hopes were not entirely the o£6apring of
my wishes and imagination.
'I mean to take up Mr. We < ;tort Instead of Mr. Hatfield,'
siud my companion, after a short pause, resuming something
of her usual cheerfulness.'The ball at Ashby Park takes
place OD Tuesday, you know ; and mamma thinks it very
likely that Sir Thomas will propose to me then : such things
are often done in the piivacy of the ball-room, when gentle-
men are most easily ensnaredj and ladies moat enchanting.
But if I am to be maiiied so soon, I must make the best of
the present time : I am determined Hatfield shall not b^
the only man who shall lay his heart at my feet^ and implore
me to accept the worthless gift in vain.'

CHAPTER XVII
CONFESSIONS
Ab I am in ths way of confeBsionSj I ma.y as well acknowledge
that, about this time, I paid more attention to dress than
ever I had done before. This is not saying much ; for
hitherto I had boea a littlo n^lectful in that particular ; but
nowj also, it waa no uncomn^on thing to spend as much as
two minutes in the contemplation of my own imago in the
glasa ; though I never could derive any consolation from
such a study. I could discover no beauty in those marked
features, that pale hollow cheekt and ordinary dark brown
hair; there might be intellect in the forehead^ there might be
expression in the dark grey eyes, but what of that ? — a low
Grecian brow, and larg^ black eyes devoid of sentimBQfc
would be esteemed far preferable. It is foolish to wish for
beauty. Sensible people never either desire it for themselves
or care about it in others. If the mind be but well
cultivated, and the heart well disposed, no one ever cares for
the exterior. So said the teachers of our childhood ; and so
say we to the childi'en of the present day. All very judicious
and proper, no doubt ; but are euch assertions supported by
actual experience?
We are naturally di8posed to love what gives us pleastirei
& zid what more pleasing than a l > eautiful face — when we know
no harm of the possessor at least? A little girl loves her
bird — Why? Because it lives and feela; beca.liB6 it is
helpless and harmless? A toad, likewise, Lives and feels^
and is equally helpless and harmless ; but Lhongh she would
not hurt a toad, she cannot love it like the birdi with its

496 AGNES GREY
gr & cefQl form, Boft feathers^ and brigbt, speebkiiig eyeo. If
woman U fair £ind amiable^ ahe ia pmsed for both quali^es*
but oBpeoially the formor, by tho bulk of mankind : if, on the
other hcind, she is disagreeable in person and character, her
plaianess is commoaly inveighed against as her greatest
crime, because, to common ob^rvers, it gives the greatest
offence ; while, if she ia plain and good^ provided she ia t
person of retired manners and secluded life, no one ever
knows of her goodness^ except her immediate connectioiis.
Others, on the contrary^ are disposed to form unfavourabk
opinions of her mind and dispodtion, if il be but to eioose
themaelvea for their instinctive dislike of one so unfavoured
by nature ; and vice versd with her whose angel fonu
conceals a vicious heart, or sheds a false, deceitful ch & no
over defects and foibles that would not be tolerated in
another. They that have beauty, let them be thankful for il,
and make a good use of it, like any other talent ; thej ih & l
have it not, let them conaolo themBelves^ and do the best they
can without it: certainly, though liable t-o be ovet-estunated.
it IB a gift of Cod^ and not to be despised. Many will feel
this who have felt that they could love, and ^hosebeailii tell
them that they are worthy to be loved again ; while yet they
are debaired, by the lack of this or some such seeming uifle,
from giving and receiving that happiness they seem almost
made to feel and to impart. As well might the hmnble
glowworm despise that power of giving light without whict
the roving fly might pass her and repass her a thousiiod
times, and never rest beside her ^ she might hear her winged
darling buzzing over and around her ; he vainly seeking bdr.
she longing to be found, but with no power to make hat
presence known, no voice to call him, no wings to follow lui
flight ;^the fly must seek another mate» the worm must lirs
and die alone*
Such were some of my reflections about this period, I!

thai might etartle his prejudices, orp perhapB, provoke hia
ridicule, because he could not comprehend them ; but I for-
bear.
NoWf therefore, let ua return to Miss Murray. She
acGompanied her mamma to the ball on Tuesday ; of course
splendidly attired, and delighted with her prosppcts and her
charms. As Ashby Park was nearly ten miles distant from
Horton Lodge, they had to set out pretty early, and I
intended to have spent the evening with Nancy Brown,
whom I had not seen for a long time ; but my kind pupil
took care I should spend it neither there nor anywhere else
beyond the limits of the schoolroom, by giving me a piece of
mu^c to copy, which kept me closely occupied till bed-time.
About eleven next; morning, as soon as she had left her room,
Bhe came to tell me her news. Sir Thomas had Indeed pro-
posed to her at the ball ; an event which refiecbed great credit
on her mammals sagacity, if not upon her akill in contri-
vance^ I rather incline to the belief that she had first laid
her plans, and then predicted their auccesa. The offer had
been accepted, of course, and the bridegroom elect wafl
coming that day to settle matters with Mr. Murray.
Bosalie was pleased with the thoughts of becoming
mistress of Ashby Park ; she was elated with the prospect of
the bridal ceremony and its attendant splendour and ^lat,
the honeymoon spent abroad, and the subsequent gaieties
she expected to enjoy in London and elsewhere ; she appeared
pretty well pleased too, for the time being, with Sir Thomas
himself, because she had so lately seen him, danced with
him, and been flattered by him ; but, after all, she seemed to
ahrink from the idea of being so soon united ; she wished
the ceremony to be delayed some months, at least ; and I
wished it too. It seemed a horrible thing to hurry on the
inauspicioua match, and not to give the poor creature time to
think and reason on the irrevocable step she was about to
take. I made no pretension to'arDOther's watchful, anxious
care,* but I was amazed and horrified at Mra. Murray's
heartlessness, or want of thought for the real good of her

child; and by my tinheaded wamingg and exhortations, I
vainly strove to remedy the evil Miss Murruy only Uoghed
at what I snid ; and I soon found that her relactance lo ui
immediate union arose chiefiy from a desire to do wha4
execution she could among the young gentlemen of her
acquaintance, before she was incapacitated from furiher
mischief of the kind. It was for this cause that, before con-
Bding to me ths secret of her ongagcment^ she bad extracted
a promisa that I would not mention a word on the subject to
any one. And when I saw this, and when I beheld her
ptunge more reckl^sly than ever into the depths of bdartl^a
coquetry, I had no more pity for her, * Come what will,* I
thought,'she de^rvea it. Sir Thomas cannot be too bad for
her ; and fche sooner she is incapacitated from deo^TiDg aod
injuring others the better.'
The wedding waa fixed lor the first of June. Between
that and the critical ball was little more than six weeks ; bat.
with Bosalle's accomphshed skill and resolute exertion, much
might be done, even within that period ; especially as Sir
Thomas spent most of the interim in LondoD ; whither he
went up, it was said, to settle affairs with his lawyer, and
make other preparatiotis for the approaching nuptials. He
endeavoured to supply the want of his presetioe by a protty
constant fire of billots-doux ; but these did not stiract tfaa
neighbours* attention, and open their eyes, & & personal riaite
would have done ; and old Lady Ashby's haughty, fiour spirit
of reserve withheld her from spreading the news, while her
indifferent health prevented her coming to visit her fntnre
daughter-in-law ; so thatr altogether, this aSalr was kept far
closer than such things usually are.

Meantime, young Melfcham was pretty frequent in his visits
to the house or truLnsits past it ; and, judging by Matilda's
execratiiong and reproac^hes, her sister paid more attention to
him than civility required ; in other worda, she carried oo as
animated a flirtation as the presence of her parents would
adroit. She made some attempts to bring Mr. Hatfield once
more to ber feet ; but finding them unBuocessfuIp she repaid
his banghty indifTerenoe with still loftier scorn, and spoke of
him with as much disdain and detestation as she had formerly
done of his curate. But« amid all thisj she never for a
moment lost sight of Mr, Weston, She embraced every
opportunity of meeting him, tried every art to fascinate him,
and pursued him with as much peraevei'ance as if she really
loved bim and no other, and the happiness of ber life
depended upon elioiting a return of affection* Such conduct
was completely beyond my coroprehenaion. Had I seen it
depicted in a novel, I should have thought it unnatural ; hod
I heard it deaaribed by others, I should have deemed it a
mistake or an exaggeration ; but when I saw it with my own
eyes, and suffered from it too* I could only conclude that

She now became extremely beneficent to the poor
cottagers. Her acquaintance among them was more widely
extended, her visits to their humble dwellings were moti3
fre < |iient and excui*sive than ihey had ever been before.
Hereby, she earned among them the reputation of a OOO'
descending and very charitable young lady ; and their
encomiums wei^e sure to be repeated to Mr. Weston : wbotn
also she had thus a daily chance of meeting in one or other
of their abodc^s^ or in her transits to and fro ; and often, like-
wise, $he could gather, through their gossip, to what places
he was likely to go at such and such a time, whether to
baptize a childi or to visit the aged, the sick, the sad, or the
dying; and most skilfully she laid ber plans accordingly.
In these excursions she would sometimes go with her sister
— whom, by some means, she had persuaded or bribed to
enter Into her schemes — sometimes alone, never, now, with
me ; so that I was debarred the pleasure of seeing Mr. Weston,
or hearing his voice even in converaation with another;
which would certainly have been a very great pleasure, how-
ever hurtful or however fraught with pain. I could not even
see him at church : for Miss Mun^ay, under some trivial pne-
text, chose to take possession of that comer in the family
pew which had been mine ever since I came ; and, unless I
had the presurnption to station myself between Mr. and Mrs*
Murray, I roust sit with my back to the pulpit^ which I
accordingly did.
Now, also, I never walked home with my pupils : they
aaid their mamma thought it did not look well to see three
people out of the family walking, and only two going in the
carriage; and, as they greatly preferred walking in fine
weather, I should be honoured by going with the seniors-
'And besides/ said they^'you can't walk as fast as we do;
you know you're always lagging behind.'I knew these wen

false excuses^ but I tna.de no objeotioaa, and never oontra-
dioted such & BGertionB, well knowing the motives which
dictated them. And in the aftemoona, during those six
memorable weekBj I never went U > ohoroh at ail. If I had a
cold, or any slight indispositioo, they took advantage of that
to make me stay at home ; and often they would teU me
they were not going tkgain that day, themselves, and then
pretend to change their minds, and set off without telling
me ; so managing their departure that I never discovered the
change of purpose till too late. Upon their retniTi home, on
one of these oceasionBj they entertained me with an animated
account of a eonversatlon they had had with Mr. Weston as
they came along.'And he asked if you were LQ, Miss Grey/
Bald Matilda ;'hut we told him you were quite well, only
you didn't want to come to chuich — bo he'll think you're
turned wicked.'
All chanoe meetings on week-days were likewise carefully
prevented ; for, lest I should go to see poor Nancy Brown or
any other person, Miss Murray took good care to provide
sufScient employment for all my leisure hours. There was
always some drawing to finish, some music to copy, or some
work to do, su^cient to incapacitate me from indulging ia
anything beyond a short walk about the grounds, however
^e or her sister might be occupied.
One morning, having sought and waylaid Mr, Weston,
they returned in high glee to give me an account of their
interview,'And he asked after you again,'said Matilda, in
spite of her sister's silent bub imperative intimation that she
should hold her tongue.'He wondered why you were never
with U9, and thought you must have delicate health, as you

pleasure in anything else/

It waa no use beginning to dispute with Bucb indulged,
unreasoning creatures : so I held my peace. I was
accustomed^ now» to keeping Bileuce when things distopateful
to my ear were uttered ; and now, too, I was used to wearing
a pkcid smiling countenance when my heart was bitter
within me. Only thoae who have felt the like can imagine
my feelings, as I sat with an assumption of smiling indiffer-
ence, listening to the accounts of those meeiinp and inter-
views with Mr. Weston, which they seemed to find such
pleasure in de^ribtng to me ; and hearing things asserted < ^
him which, from the character of the man, I knew to be ex-
aggerations and perversions of the tmth, if not entirely f ala^^
things derogatoi'y to him, stad flattering to them- — especially
to Miss Murray — which I burned to contradict* or, i% leaad
to show my doubts about, but dared not ; lest, in expnsaenig
my disbeliefi I should display my interest too. Other thingi
I heard, which I felt or feared were indeed too true r but I
must Btill conceal my anxiety respecting hiii], my indignation
against them^ beneath a careless aspect ; others, ftgiun, mere
bints of something Boad or done, which I longed to hearmort
of, but could not venture to inquire. Bo passed the wieary
time. I could not even comfort myself with saying,'8hd wilt
soon be married ; and then there may be hope.*
Boon after her marriage the holidays would oome ; and
when I returned from home, most likely, Mr. Weston would
be gone, for I was told that he and the Bee tor could uoi

No — besides my hope in God, my only consolation waB
m thinking th & t, though he knew it not, I was more worthy
of his love than Rosalie Murray, charming and engaging as
she WELs ; for I could appreciate his excellence, which she
could not : I would devote my life to the promotion of his
happiness ; she would destroy his happiness for the momen-
tary gratification of her own vanity, * Oh, if he could but
know the diEference 1'I would earnestly exclaim.'But no I
I would not have him see my heart: yet» if he could but
know her hollowness, her worthless^ heartless frivolity, he
would then be safe, and I should be — al?nost happy, though I
tnight never see him more !'
I fear, by this time, the reader is well nigh disgusted
with the folly and weakness I have so freely laid before him.
I never disclosed it then, and would not have done so had
my own sister or my mother been with me in the house, I
was a close and resolute dissembler— in this one case at
least. My prayei^t my tears, my wishes, fears, and iamenta-
tionSf were witness & d by myself and heaven alone.
When we are harassed by sorrows or aasieties, or long
oppressed by any powerful feelings which we must keep to
ourselvea, for which we can obtain and seek no sympathy
from any living creaturej and which yet we cannot, or will
not wholly crush, we often naturally seek relief in poetry —
and often find it, too — whether in the effusions of othersj
which seem to harmonize with our existing case, or in our
own attempts to give utterance to those thoughts and feelings
in strains less musical, perchance, but more appropriate, and
therefore more penetrating and sympathetic, and, for the time^
more soothing, or more powerful to rouse and to unburden
the oppressed and swollen heart. Before this time» at
Wellwood House and here, when suffering from home-sick
melancholy, I had sought relief twice or thrice at this secret
Bouroe of coneolaUoa ; and now I flew to it again, with
groater avidity than ever, because I seemed to need it more.

suddenly returningj embraced me with more aSfection tba " I
thought her capable of evincing, and departed with tears in
her eyes- Poor girl 1 I really loved bar then ; aod forg & n
her from my heart all the injury she had done me— -and
others also: she had not half known it. I was sure; and I
prayed God to pardon her too.
Puring the remainder of that day of featal s^aesSj I wrf


AGNES GREY
507
left to my own devices. Being too much unhinged for any
steady occupalion, I wandered about with s, book in noy hand
for several hours, more thinking than reading, for I had many
things to think a})ont. In the evening, I made use of my
liberty to go and see my old friend Nancy once again ; to
apologise for tny long absence (which muat have seemed so
neglectful and unkind) by telling her how busy I had been ;
and to talk, or read, or work for hor, whichever might he
most acceptable, and also, of course, to tell her the news of
thia importaBt day : and perhaps to obtain a little imforma-
tion from her in refcuj-n, respecting Mr. Weaton's expected
departure. But of this she seemed to know nothing; and I
hoped, as she did, that it was all a false report. She was
\»ery glad to see me; but, happily, her eyes were now bo
Dearly well that she was almost independent of my services-
She was deeply interested in the wedding; but while I
amused her with the details of the feetiv^e day, the splendours
of the bridal party and of the brida herself, she often sighed
and shook her head, and wished good might come of it ; she
seemed, like me, to regard it rather as a theme for sorrow
than rejoicing. 1 sat a long time talking to her about that
and other things — but no one came.
Shall I confess that I sometimes looked towards the door
with a half-expectant wish to see it open and give entrance
to Mr. Weston, as had happened once before? and that,
retaming through the lanes and felds^ I often paused to look
round me, and walked more slowly than was at all necessary
- — for, though a fine evening, it was not a hot one — and^
finally, felt a sense of emptiness and diaappointmentat having
reached the house without meeting or even catching a distant
glimpse of any one^ except a few labourers returning from
their work ?
Sunday, however, was approaching : I should see him
then : for now that Mies Murray was gone, I could have my
old comer again. I should see him, aud by look, speech,
and manner, I might judge whether the circumstance of her
marriage had very much afflicted him. Happily I could
iSOS
AGNES GBEY
perceive no shadow of a difiference: he wore the B & me
aspect aB he had'wom two months ago — voice, took, manner,
all alike unchanged : there was the same keen -sighted,
unolouded tiiithfulness in hie discourse, the same forcible
clearness in his style, the same earnest simplicity in & U he
said and didt that made itself, not marked by the eye And
e^, but felt upon the hearts of his audience*
I walked home with Miss Matilda ; but ke did not join
us. Matilda was now flad]y at a loss for amu^menb, aod
wofuUy in want of a companion : her brothers at school, her
sister married and gone, she too young to be admitted bto
society ; for which, from Bosahe's example^ sh© waa in sotue
degree beginning to acquire a taste — a taste at least for the
company of certain classes of gentlemen ; at this dull tiine
of year — no hunting going on, no shooting even — for, though
she might not join in that, it was somethtTig to see het father
or the gamekeeper go out with the dogs, and to talk wilb
them on their return, about the different birds they had bagged.
Now, alsoj she was denied the solace which the companioi^-
ship of the coachman, grooms, horses, greyhounds, acd
pointers might have afforded; for her mother having,
notwithsianding the disadvantages of a country life, sa
satisfacUtrily disposed of her elder daughter, the pride of ber
heart had begun seriously to turn her attention to the
younger ; and, being truly alarmed at the roughness of htf
manners, and thinking it high time to work a reform, had
been roused at leugth to exert her authority, and prohibited
entirely the yards, Btablee, kennels, and coachhouse^ Of
course, she was not implicitly obeyed ; but, indulgent as sbe
had hitherto been, when once her spirit was roused, het
temper was not so gentle as she required thai of hsr
governesses to be^ and her will was not to be thwarted wilh
impunity. After many a scene of contention heween mothor
and daughter, many a violent outbreak which I was aBbame^
to witness, in which the father*3 authority was often ctXkd
in to confirm with oaths and threats the mother's dlighiei
prohibitions — for even he could see that * Tilly, thoQ^ sbi

AGNES GBEY
em
I rtn
would have made a fine Ud, was not quliie whSht a young lady
ought to he * — Matilda at length found that hei* easiest plan
waa to keep clear of the foibiddea regions ; unless she could
now and then steal a viait without her watchful mother's
owledge.
Amid all this, let it not be imaging that I escaped with-
out many a reprimand, and many an implied reproo^h, that
lost none of ita ating from not being openly worded; but
T & thar wounded the more deeply, b^uae, from that very
renison, it seemed to preclude self-defence. Frequently, I
^as told to amuse Miss Matilda with other things^ and to
remind her of her mother's precepts and prohibitiona, I did
flo to the beat of ray power ; but she would not be amused
against her will, and could not against her tasto ; and though
I went beyond mere reminding, such gentle remonstrances
as I could uae were utterly ineffectual.
'i?/Mtr Miss Grey ! it is the stran^jest thing. I suppose
you can't help it, if it's not in your nature — but I wonder
you can't win the confidence of that girl, and make your
society at least as agreeable to her as that of Bobert or

* They can talk the beat Ekbout the things in which she is
most interested/ I replied,
'Weill that is a strange confeeaion^ howeveTf to oome
frcm her govcrnesa I Who is to form a young lady's tastes,
I wonder, if the governess doesn't do it? I have known
govemeases who have so completely identified themselves
TOth the reputation of their young ladies for elegance and
propriety in mind and manners, that they would bkish to
speak a word against them ; and to hear the slightest blame
imputed to their pupils was worae than to be censured in
their own persons — and I really think it very natural, for my
part/
'Do you, ma'am ? *
• Yes, of course : the young lady's proficiency and
elegance is of more consequence to the governess than her
ovm, as well as to the world. If she wishes to prosper in
filO
AGNES GRE7

her vocation she must devobe all her energi^ to ber
businesa: all hsr ideas and all her anibitton will tend to the
Accomplishment of th & t one object. When we wish to
decide upon the toorits of a goremegs, we naturally look U
the young lEidiea she prof & Bses to have educated, aod jad^
accordingly. The jttdicious governess knows this : she
knows that, while she lives in obscurity herself, her pupalfi*
yii'tues and defects will be open to every eye; and ^b & l,
unless she loses sight of herself in tbeir cultivation, she need
not hope for success. You see» Miss Grey, it is juet the
same as any other li^de or profession ; they that wish to
prosper must dovote themselves body and soul io their
calling i and if they begin to yield to indoleiice or self-indul-
gence they are speedily distanoed by wiser competitors : then
is little to choose between a pei*son that ruins her pupils bj
neglect, and one-that corrupts them by her example. Yon
will excuse my dropping these little hints : you know it is
all for your own good. Many ladies would speak to you mud)
more strongly ; and many would not trouble themselves to
speak at ^U, but quietly look out Cor a substitute. That, d
ooursej would be the easiest plan : but I know the advan-
tages of a place like this to a person in your situation ; and I
have no desire to part with you, as I am sure you would do
very well if you will only think of these things and try to
exert yourself a little more: then, I am convinced, jtm
would soon acquire that delicate tact which alone is w«dI»
ing to give you a proper influence over the mind of jonr
pupil,'
I W & 8 about to give the lady some idea of the fallacy d
her c^^pectations ; but she sailed away as soon as she h^
concluded her speech. Ha\ing said what she wished, it wif
no part of her plan to await my answer ; it waa my basiDen
to hear, and not to speak.
However, as I have said. Matilda at length yielded in
eome degree to her roother*8 authority (pity it had not been
exerted before) ; and being thus deprived of almost eraj
Bource of amusement, there was nothing for it but to Itk

long ridea with the groom and long yvslks with tbe goveiTiesfl,
^ad tfO visit the cottages and farmhouses on her father's
estate^ to kill time in chatting with the old mea and women
that inhabited them. In one of these walka, it was our
chance to meet Mr. Weston. This was what I had long
desired ; hut now, for a moment^ I wished either he or I
were away : I felt my heart throb bo violently that I dreaded
lest some outward signs of emotion should appoar ; but I
think he hardly glanced at me.iuid I waa soon calm enough.
After a brief salutation to both, be asked Matilda if she had
lately heard from her siater,
* Yee/ replied she,'She was at Paris when she wrote,
and very well, and very happy.'
She spoke the last word emphatically, and with a glance
impertinently sly. He did not seem to notice it, but i-epUed,
with equal emphaBis, and very seHoualy —
'I hope she will continue to be so.'
* Do you think it likely ?'I ventured to inquire : for
Matilda had stai-tod oS in pursuit of her dog, that was chas-
ing a leveret.
'I cannot tell,* replied he,'Sir Thomas may be a better
man than I suppose ; but, from all I have heard and seen, it
fteema a pity that one so young and gay, and — and interesiingf
to express many things by one word — whose greatest, if not
her only fault, appears to be thoughtlessness — no trifling
fault to be sure, since it renders the possessor liable to almost
every other, and esposea him to so many temptations— but
it aoems a pity that she should be thrown away on such a
man. It was her mother's wish, I suppose ?'
* Yes; and her own too, I think, for she alwaya laughed
at my attempts to dissuade her from the step.'
'You did attempt it? Then, at least, you will have the
satisfaction of knowing that it is no fault of yours, if any
harm should come of it. As for Mrs. Murray, I don't know
how she can justify her conduct: il I had sufficient acquaint-

better pleased to see it killed. However, you c & n bolb

Mr. Weston was now gone, and we too went oil our way f

CHAPTER SIX
THE LETTEB
Mt father's mortal remains had been consi^ed to tbetombr
and W3« with sad fuices and sombre garments, sat lin^snng
over tho frugal breakfast-table, revolving pl & ns for oor
future life. My mother's strong mind had not given way
beneath even this afflictpion : ber spirit, though ci~u & hed, waa
not broken. Mark's wish was that I should ga back ki
Horton Lodge, and that our mother should come and lire
with her and Mr. Itichardson at the vicarage : ehe affirmed
that he wished it no less than herself, and that such u
arrangemcDt could net fail to benefit all parties ; for coj
mother's society and experience would be of inefitimaU«
value to them, and they would do all they ooold to make ber
happy. Bat no arguments or entrealies could prevail : my
mother was determined not to go. Not that ahe queatiooed,
for a moment, the kind wishes and intentions of her daughter;
but she affirmed that so long as God spared her heal^ and
strength, she would make use of them to earn her own tivefi-
hood« and be chargeable to no one ; whether her dependenoe
would he felt as a burden or not. If she could afford to
reside as a lodger in vicarage, she would choose ihil
house before all others as the place of her abode ; but ik)I
being so circumstanced, she would Dever come under its roo2i
except as an occasional visitor ^ unless sickness or caUmitl
should render her assistance really needful, or a & til ags tf
infirmity made her incapable of maint^ning herself.
'No, Mary/ said she,'if Eiohardson and you ban

HjiythiDg to Bpare, you must lay it aiside for your family ; & nd
Agnes and I must gather honey for ourselvea. Thanks to
my having had daughters t-o educate, I have not forgotten
my aocomplishmentB. Go < i willing^ I will check this vain
repiniug/ she said, while the bears coursed one another down
her cheekB in spite of her efforts ; hut she wiped (hem away,
and resolutely shaking haok her head, continued, *I will
exert myself, and look out for a small houae» commodiously
situated in some populous but healthy district, where wo
will take a few young ladies to board and educate — if we can
get them — and as many day pupils as will come, or as wa
can manage to instruct. Your father's relations and old
friends will ho able to send us some pupils, or to assist us
with their recommendations, no doubt : I shall not apply to
my own. What say you to it, Agnes 7 will you be willing
to leave your present situation and try ? *
'Quite willing, mamma ; and the money I have saved
will do to furnish the house. It shall be taken from the bank
directly/
'When it is wanted : we must get the house, and setilo
on preliminaries first.'
Mary offered to lend the little she possessed; but my
mother declined it, saying that we must begin on an
economical plan ; and shB hoped that the whole or part of
mine, added to what we could get by the sale of the furniture,
and what little our dear papa had contrived to lay aside for
her since the debts were paid, would be su3icient to last us
till Christmas ; when, it was hoped, something would accrue
from our united labouis. It was finally settled that this
Bhould be our plan ; and that inquiries and preparations
fthould ImoiediatBly be set on foot ; and while my molbef
busied herself with these, I should return to Horton Liodge
at the close of my four weeks'vacation, and give notice for
my final departure wheii thii^gs were in train for the speedy
oommencetuent of our school.
We were discussing these affairs on the morning I have
mentiooed, about a fortnight alter my father's death, when
518
AGNES GREY

fr letter was brought in for my mother, on beholdiog wWd
the colour mounted to her face — lately pale enough with
anxious watchiaga ajid excessive sorrow.'Prom my father!'
murmured she, aa she hastily tore off the cover. It was
many yeara since she had heard from any of her owu
relatioaa before. Naturally wondering what the letter might
oontain, I watched her countenance while she read it, And
was somewhat surprisod to see her bite her lip and knit her
browa aa if in anger. When she had done, she somewhM
irreverently cast it on the table, saying with a aoomful smile,
— * Your grandpapa haft been so kind as to write to me. He
Bays he has no doubt I have long repented of my " " unfortunate
marriage, " and i.f I will only acknowledge this, and confess I
was wrong in neglecting his advice, and that I have justly
suffered for it, he will make a lady of mo once again — ^if thai
bo poasihle after my long degradation — and remember my
girU in his wiU* Get my de & k, Agnes, and send these
things away : I will answer the letter directly. But first, aa
I may be depriving you both of a legacy, it ia jaat that I
should tell you what I mean to say. I shall say that he is
mistaken in supposing that I can regret the biith of mj
daughters (who have been the pride of my life, and are likdv
to be the comfort of my old age), or the thirty years I ha^
passed in the company of my best and dearest friend ; —
had our misfortunes been three times as great as they
(unleGB they had been of my bringing on), I should still
more rejoice to have shared them with your father, and
admmistercd what consolation I was able : and, had hia
sufferings in illness been ten times what they were, I oould
not regret having watched over and laboured to
them ; — that, if ho had married a richer wife, misJo
and trials would no doubt have come upon him still ;
I am egotist enough to imagine that no other woman oooM
have clieered him through them so weU : not that I ara
superior to the rest, but I was made for him, and he for me;
and I can no more repeat the hours, days, years of happiness
we have spent together, and which neither could have had
hava_
i
and

without the other, than I can the privilege of having heen
his nurse in sickness, and his comfort in afiSiction.
* Will this do, children ?— or shall I say we are all very
sorry for what has happened during the last thirty years, and
my daughters wish they had never been bom ; but since
they have had that misfortune, they will be thankful for any
trifle their grandpapa will be kind enough to bestow ?'
Of course, we both applauded our mother's resolution ;
Mary cleared away the breakfast things ; I brought the desk ;
the letter was quickly written and despatched; and, from
that day, we heard no more of our grandfather, till we saw
his death announced in the newspaper a considerable time
after — all his worldly possessions, of course, being left to our
wealthy unknown cousins.
CHAPTER XX
TEE FABSWELL
A HOUBS in A 1 the fashionable watering-plaoBt was
hired for our seminary ; and a promise of two or three papib
was obtained to commence with. I returned to Hortoo
IjodgB ahout the middle of July, leaving my mother to
conclude the bargain for the house, to obtain more pupils, to
seU oS tho furniture of our old abodci and to fit out the new
one.
We often pity the poor, because they have no leiaure to
mourn their departed relativea, and necessity obliges them
to labour thi'ough their severest afflictions : but is not active
employment the best remedy for overwhelming sorrow — ibd
surest antidote for despair? It may be a rough comforle?;
it may seem hard to be haraBsed with tho cares of life when
we have no relish for its enjoyments ; to be goaded to Uboor
when the heart is ready to break, and the vexed spirit
implores for rest only to weep in silence : but is not labour
better than the rest we covet? and are not those pett|,
tormenting cares less hurtftd than a continual brooding OM^H
tho great afiliction that oppresses us? Besides^ we o & od^l
have cares, and anxieties, and toil, without hope— if it he bui
the hope of fulfiUing our joyless task, accompli^ing soms
needful project, or escaping some further annoyanoe. Al any
ratOf I WEi^ glad my mother had so much employment foe
every faculty of her action-loving frame. Our
neighbours tamented that she, oticcs bo exalted Ln wealth
station, should be reduced to such extremity in her
sorrow ; but I am persuaded that she would hM.v% si

thrice as much had she been left in affluence, with liberty to
remain in that house, the Boene of her early hsippinoas and
late affliction, and no stern nftcGaelty to prevent her from
incesaantly brooding over and lamenting her bereavement-
I will not dilate upon the feelings with which I left the
old houset the well-known garden, the little village church —
then doubly deal'to me, becauae my father, who, for thirty
years, had taught and prayed within its walls, lay slumbering
now beneath itB flag^ — and the old bare hills, delightful in
Uieir very desolation, with the narrow voles between,
smiling in green wood and sparkling water — the house where
I was born, the scene of all my early asBOciationa, the place
where throughout life my earthly affections had been centred ;
— and left thotn to return no more I True. I was going back
to Horton Lodge, where, amid many evils, one source of
pleasure yet remained : but ft was pleasure mingled with
excessive pain ; and my stay, alas I was limited to six weeks.
And even of that precious time, day after day slipped by and
I did not see faim : except at church, I never saw him for ft
fortnight after my return. It seemed a long time to me :
and, as I was often out with my rambling pupil, of course
hopes would keep rising, and disappointmenia would ensue ;
and then, I would say to my own hearty'Here is a convincing
proof — if you would but have the sense to see it, or the
candour to acknowledge it— that he does not care for you.
If he only thought /m//as much about you as you do al > out

this : you must know that, by consulting yom? own feelings.
Therefore, have done with this nonsense : you have no
ground for hope : dismiss, a^t once, these hurtful thoughta
id fooliHh wishes from your mind, and turn to your own
ity, and the dull blank life that lies before you. You might
iiVG Jencvm such happiness was not for you/
But I saw him at last. He came suddenly upon me as I
crossing a field in returning from a visit to Nancy Brown,
I had taken the opportunity of paying while Matilda
Lurray was riding her matchless mare. He must have

AGNES GREY


he & rd of the heavy loss I had sustained : he expressed nc
sympathy, offered no condolence : but almost the first words
he uttered were, —'How U your mother ? * And this waa do
matter-of-couise question, fori never told him thatlAo^lft
mother; he must have learned the fact from others, i[ he
knew it at all ; and» besides, there was sincere goodwill, aad
even deep, touching^ unobtrusive sympathy in the tone and
manner of the inquiry. I thanked him with due civility, and
told him bhe wels as well as could be expected. * What will
she do ?'was the next question. Many would have deemad
it Ein impertinent one^ and given an evasive reply ; but sadi
an idea never entered my head, and I gave a brief but plain
statement of my mother's plans and prospects.
'Then you will leave this place shortly ? * said he.
'Yea, in a month. "
He paused a minute, as if in thought. When he
again f I hoped it would be to express his concern al
departure ; but it was only to say,^'I should thiolc yoa
ho willing enough to go ?'
* Yes — for some things,'I replied.
'For some things only — I wonder what ehould m & keyoQ
regret it ?'
I was annoyed at thia in some degree ; because it embv-
raaaed me : I had only one reason for regretting it ; and th*t
was a profound secret, which he had no business to troiiy«
me about.
'Why,'said I —'why should you suppose that I dislib
the plaee ? *
* You told me so yourself/ was the dedsive reply-'Yoa
said, at least, that you could not live coDtentedly, without!
friend ; and thiit you had no friend htirt*, and no possibi!
of making one — and, besides, I know you must didike iu*
* But if you remember rightly^ I said, or meant to ay,

was not so unreasonable as to require one alwaye near a*
I think I could be happy in a house full of enemies, if—'
but no J that sentence must not be continued — I paused,
AGNES GREY
hastily added, —'And^ bBsides^ we cannot well leave a place
where we have lived for two or three yeitra, without souio
lee hug of regi'et.'
* Will you regret to part with Miaa Murray, your sole
remaining pupil a»nd companion? *
'I da£^ say I shall in some degree : it was not without
sorrow I parted with her sister/
* I can imagine thnt.'
'Wellj Miss Matilda is quite as good — better in one
respect.'
'What is that?'
* She's honest.'
'And Lhe other is not ? *
'I should not call her ^whoneat ; but it must be confessed
she fl a little artful.'
'Art/id is §he? — I saw she was gtddy and vain--and now,'
be added, after a pau & e,'I can well believe nhe was artful
too ; but so excessively so as to assume an aspect of extreme
Bimplidty and unguarded openness. Yes,'continued he,
musingly^'that accounte for some little things that puzzled
me a trifle before/
After that^ he turned the conversation to more geoeral
BubJBcta. He did not leave me till we had nearly reached the
park-gatea : he had certainly stepped a little out of his way
to accompany me so far, for he now went back and dis-
appeared down Mo39 Lane, the entrance of which we had
passed some time before. Assuredly I did not regret this
circumstance : if sorrow had any place in my heai't^ it was
that be was gone at laat-^that ha was no longer walking by
my side, and that that short interval of delightful intercourse
was at an end. He had not breathed a word of love, or
dropped one hint of tenderness or affection, and yet I had
been supremely happy. To be near him, to hear hdm talk & a
be did talk, and bo feel that he thought me worthy to be so
spoken to — capable of understanding and duly appreciating
eucb discourse — was enough,
'Yesj Edward Weston, I could indeed be happy in a

except, of course, a.t church.
And now, the lai^t Sunday wbs come, and the laAtgervtoe-
I was often on the point of melting into tears during the

the two Mis^B Green. They had many tnquinea to in & ke
about her sifter, and I know not what besides. I only widbed
they would have done, that we might hasten back lo Hortoa
Lodge : I longed to seek the retirement of my own room, or
Bome sequestered nook in the grounds, that I mi^jht delifV
myself up to my feelings— to weep my last farewell^ aoJ
lament my false hopes and vain delusions. Only thia otwn
and then adieu to fruitless drefl,miag — thenceforth, ouly sober,

resol^^ed, a low voice close beside me said — * I suppose you
are going this week, Mias Grey ?'* Yes/ I replied. I waa
very much startled ; and h & d I been at oXl hystencall^
inclinedj I certaiDly should have cocmnitted myself in some
way then. Thank God, I was not.
* Well,'said Mr, Weston,'I want to bid you good-bye — it

* Good-bye, Mr, Weston,'I said. Oh, how I struggled to
say it calmly * I gave bim my hand. He retiviaed it a few

that moment, a succession of sobs would have inevitably
ensued ; and as it was, I oould not keep the water out of my
eyes, I walked along with Miss Murray, turning aside my
face, and neglecting to notice several successive remarks, titi
she bawled out that I was either deaf or stupid ; and then
(having recovered my seU-possession), a$ one awaken & d from
a fit of abstraction, I suddenly looked up and asked what she

CHAPTER XXI
TH£ SOROOL
I LG7T Horton Lodge, and went to join my mother in our
new ftbode at A , I found her well m health, resigned in
spirit, and even cheerful, though subdued and sober, in her
general demea^nour. We had oaly three boarders Euid b^A
dozen day-pupila to commeoce with ; but by due care & iui
diligence we hoped ere long to increase the nuEnber of both.
I set myself with befi.tting energy to discharge the dnties
of this new mode of life. I call it new^ for there was, indeeii.
B, considerable difference between wording with my mother
in a school of our own, and working as u hineliB^ lunoog
Strangers^ despised and trampled upon by old and yotuig;
and for the first few weeks I was by no means unhappy*
is possible we may meet again,'and'will it be of
consequence to you whether we do or not?'— Those WOjrf^,
etill rang in my ear and rested on my heart ; they were
secret solace and support. * I shull Bee him again. — He
come ; or he will wiite/ No promise, m fact, wae too
bright or too extravagant for Hope to whisper in my ear. I
did not believe half of what she told me v I pretended to
laugh at it all ; but I was far more credulous than I mysolf
Bupposed ; othei'wise, why did my heart leap up when k
knock was heard at the front door, and the maid, who
opened it, came to tell my mother a gentleman wished to see
her ? and why was I out of humour for the rest of the day,
because it proved to be a music-master come to offer hi»
services to oui'school ? and what stopped my breath for t
moment, when the postmEui having brought a couple of

letters, my mother said,'Here, Agnes, this is for you,* and
threw one of them to me? and what mjide the hot blood
rush mto my face when I saw it was directed in a gentle-
man's hand? and why— -oh 1 why did that cold, sickening
sense of disappoiatmenb fall upon me, when I had torn open
the cover and found it was only a letter from Mary, which,
for some reason or other, her hu & hand had directed for her ?
Was it then come to this— ^that I should be disappointed
to receive a letter from my only sister : and because it was
not written by a compai-ative stranger? Dear Mary 1 and
she had written it bo kindly— ^and thinking I should be so
pleased to have it! — I was not worthy to read itl And I
believe^ in my indignation against myselff I shonld have put
it aside UU I had schooled myself into a better frame of n^ud,
and was become more deserving of the honour and privilege
of its perusal: but there was my mother looking on, and
wishful to know what newa it contained ; so I read it and
delivered it to her, and then went into the schoolroom to
attend to the pupils : but amidst the cares of copies and
sums — in the intervals of correcting errors here, and reprov-
ing derelictions of duty there, I was inwardly taking myself
to task with far sterner severity.'What a fool you must
be.'said my head to toy lieart, or my sterner to my softer
self ] —'how could you ever dream that he would write to
you ? Whafc grounds have you for such a hope— or that he
will see you, or give himself any trouble about you — or even
think of you again ?''What gi'ounds ?'—and then Hope
set before me that laiit, short interview^ and repeated the
words I had so faithfully treasured in my memoiy. * Well,
and what was there !n that ? — Who ever hung his hopes
upon so frail a twig? What was there in those words that
any common acquaintance might not say to another ? Of
course, it was possible you might meet again : he might
have said sc if you had been going to New Zealand ; but
that did not imply any intention of seeing you — and then, as
to the question that follo%ved, anyone might ask that : and
how did you answer? — Merely with a stupid, commonplace

528
AGNES GKEY
reply, suob aa you would have given to Master Mmrfty, or
anyone else you b & d been on toldira.bly civil terms with.'
'But, then,'persisted Hope,'the tone and manner in which
he Bpoke/ * Oh, thivt is nonsense I he always speaks iiu-
preeaively ; and a.t > that moment thgre were the Greens & ud
Misa Mfttildoi Mnnuy just bofore^ and other people p & saing

apeak very low^ unless ho wished everybody to hei^r what ht^
said, which — though it was oothing at all particular— of
course, he would rather net.'But then, above all» thai

pray repent and amend, and let us have no more of it 1'
I cannot say that I implicitly obeyed my own injunctions:
but such reasoning as this became more and mora eCft^tire
aa time woro on, aud nothing was seen or heard of Mr.
Weston ; until, at last, I gave up hoping, for even my heart

him : I would cherish his inijige in my mind ; and treaeun
every word, look, and gesture that my memory could rvsain;

Bo laid my mother, as we s it at work one moroiDg
during the Easter holidays. I aSBured her that my employ*
ments were not at all oppressive ; that I was well ; or, if
there was anything amiss > it would he gone as soon ae the
trying months of spring were over: when suminer came I
should be as strong tiad hearty as she could wish to see me :
but inwardly her observation startled me. I knew my
strength was declining, my appetite had failed, and I wiis
grown listless and desponding ;— and if, indeed, he could
never care for me, and I could never see him more — if I was
forbidden to minister to his happiness^forbidden, for ever,
to taste the joys of love, to bless, and to be blessed— then, life
must be a burden, and if my Heavenly Father would call me
away, I should be glad to rest. Bub it would not do to die
and leave my mother. Selfish, unworthy daughter, to forget
her for a moment ! Was not her happiness committed in*a
great measure to my ehjtrge? — ^and tlm welfare of our young
pupils too ? Should I shrink from the work that God had
sat before me^ because it was not fitted to my taste? Did
not He know best what I should do, and where I ought to
labour 7 — and should I long to quit His service before I bad
finished my task, and expect to enter into His rest without
having laboured to earn it? *No ; by His help I will arise
and address myself diligently to my appointed duty. If happi-
ness in this world is not for me, I will endeavour to promote
the welfare of those around me, and my reward shall be here-
after,* So said I in my heart ; and from that hour I only per-
mitted my thoughts to wander to Edward Weston — or at least
to dwell upon him now and then — as a treat for rare occasions :
and, whether it wag really the approach of summer or the
effect of these good resolutions, or the lapse of time, or all
together, tranquillity of mind was soon restored ; and bodily
health and vigour began likewise, slowly, but surely, to return.
Early in June, I received a letter from Lady Ashby. late
iss Murray, She had written to me twice or thdce before,

630
AGNES GBEY
from the different stages of her hridal toiir, always m good
fipirita, and professing to be very happy. 1 wondered every
time thort she had not forgotten me, in the midst of so much
gaiety and variety of scene. At length, however, there waa
a pause ; and it seemed nhe had forgotten me, for upwards
of seven months passed away and no letter. Of oourae, I
did not break my heart about that, though I often wondered
how she was getting on ; and when this last epiatle bo
unexpeotadly arrived, I was glad enough to receive it. It was
dated from Ashby Park, where shewaa come to settle downM
htst, having previously divided her time between the contiiiea^
and the metropoUs. She made many apologies for haviDg
neglected me bq long, assured me she had not forgotten me,
and had often intended to ^^Tite^ ^ & o., but had always beeo
prevented by something. She acknowledged that she bad
b & en leading a very dissipated Ufe, and I should think her
very vricked and very thoughtless ; but, notwitlistanding LhAl,
ahe thought a great deal^ and, among other things, thai flbe
should vastly like to see me. * We have been several days
here already/ ^v^ote she.'We have not a single friend with
us, and are likely to be very dull. You know I neveir h^d h
fancy for living with my husband like two turtles irt a nest,
were he the most delightful creature that ever wore a coat;
so do take pity upon me mxH come. I suppose your Mid-
summer holidays commence in June, the same as other
people's ; therefore you cannot plead want of time ; and jc/a
must and shall come — in fact, I aball die if you don'k I
want you to visit me as ^ftUixd, and stay a long time. Th^e
is nobody with me, as I told you before, but Sir Thomas and
old Lady Aahby : but you needn't mind them — they'll trouble
us but httle wiih their company. And you ah^ have i
room to yourself^ whenever you like to retire to it, and plenty
of books to read when my company is not suf^ciently amndng,
I forget whether you like babies; if you do, you may hav9
the pleasure of seeing mine — the most charmitig child in the
world, no doubt ; and ail the more so, that I am not troubled
with nursing It — I was determined I wouidu*t be botbeivd

with that. Unfortunately, it is a girl, and Sir Thomas has
never forgiven me ; but, however, if you will only come, I
promise you shall be its governess as soon ae it can speak ;
and you shall bring it up in the way it should go, and make
a better woman of it than its mamma. And you eh & U see
my poodle, too : a splendid little charmer imported from
P & ris ; and two fine Italian paintings of great value — I forget
the artist. Doubtless you will be able to discover prodigious
beauties in them, which you must point out to me, aa I only
admire by hearsay; t^nd many elegant curiosities beaidesj
which I purcliased at Borne and elsewhere ; and, finally, yoa
shall see my new home — the splendid house and grounds I
used to covet so greatly. Alas ! how far the promise of
anticipation exceeds the pleasure of possession I There's a
fine sentiment I I assure you I am become quite a grave old
matron : pray come, if it be only to witness bhe v^onderful
change* Write by return of potit, and tell me when your
VEucation commences, and & ay that you will come the day
after, and stay till the day before ifc closes — in mercy to

I showed this strange epistle to my mother, and consulted
her on what I ought to do. She advised me to go ; and I
went — willing enough to see Lady Ashby, and her baby, t^:^o,
and to do anything I could to benefit her, by consolation or
advice ; for 1 imagined she must be unhappy, or she would
not have applied to me thus— but feeling, as may readily be
conceived, that, in accepting the invitation, I made a great
sacrifice for her, and did violence to my feelings in many
ways, instead of being delighted with the honourable dis-
tinction of being entreated by the baronet's lady to visit her
as a friend. However, I determined my visit should be only
for a few days at most ; and I will not deny that I derived
some consolation from the idea that, as Ashby Park was not
very far from Horton, I might possibly see Mr. Weston, or,
at least, bear somethiog about bim.

CHAPTKB XXn
THE VISIT
AsHBt Pabk was certainly a very delightful residenoe. Tte
mansion was stately withonb, commodious and elegwii
'Within ; the park wets spacious and beautiful, chiefly od
account of its tnagnificont old trees, its stately herds of deer,
its broad sheet of water, and the anciect woods that
stretched beyond it : for there was no broken ground to gir©
variety to the landscape, and but very little of that undtUat-
ing s'well wiiLch adds so greatly to the chann of park
scenery. And so. this was the place Rosalie Murray had so
longed to call her own, that she must have a share of it, on
whatever terms it might be offered— whatever price was to be
paid for the title of mistress, and whoever was to be ber
partner in the honour and bliss of such aposaassion ! Well!
I am not disposed to censure her now.
She received me very kindly ; and, though I was a
clergyman's daughter, a govomess, and a achoolmistreas,
welcomed me with unaffected pleasure to her home ; and—
what surprised mo rather — took soniG pains to makemyvisil
agreeable. I could see, it m truo, thai she expected me to be
greatly struck with the magnifieenoe that surrounded has;
and, I confoBSf I was rather annoyed at her e^Hdent eflbrtt lo
roaBStire me^ and prevent me from being overwhelmed by
80 much grandeur — too much awed at the idea of enconoter-
ing her husband and mother4n-law, or too much ashamed of
my own humble appearance. I was not ashamed of it at all;
for, though plain, I had taken good care not to be shabby or
mean, and should have been pretty considerably at my

my flondesceading hostess hod not toJcen such mi^ilest
pains bo make me so ; si,nd, as for the magnificence that
surrounded her, nothiag that met my eysa Btruck me or
affected me half so much as her own altorod appearand.
Whether from the mfluence of fashionable dissipation^ or
sorao other evil, a space of little more than twelve monfeha
had had the effect that might be expected fi'Ora as many yeara,
in reducing tho plumpness of her form, the freshness ol her
complescion^ the vivacity of hor movements, and the exuber-
ance of her spirite.
I wished to know if she was unhappy ; but I felt it was
not my province to inquire : I might endeavour to win her
confidence ; but, if sh & chose to conceal her matrimonial
cares from me, I would trouble her with no obtrusive
questions, I, therefore, at first, confined myself to a few
general inquinos R.i > out her health and welfare, eind a few
commendations on the beauty of the park» and of the Little
girl that should have been a boy : a small delicate infant
of seven or eight weeks old, whom its mother seemed to
regard with no remarkable degree of interest or aifectioD,
though full as much as I e^Lpected her to show.
Shortly after my arrival, she commissioned her maid to
conduct toe to my room and see that I had everything I
wanted ; it was a small, unpreteadingi but suflSciently
comfortable apartment. When I descended thence— having
divested myself of all travelling eacumbranoes, and arranged
my toilet with duo consideration for the feelings of my lady
hostess, she conducted me herself to the room I was to occupy
when I chose to be alone, or when sho waa engaged wiih
visitors, or obliged to be with her mother-in-law, or otherwise
prevented, as she & aid, from enjoying the pleasure of my
society. It was a quiets tidy little sitting-room; and I was
« not sorry to be provided with such a harbour of refuge.

be diimer-time» bat I bhoaght, as you were accustomed
dine atone, you would perhaps like better lo have a cup d
tea about this time, and to dine when we lunch : and ttsfiu,
you know, you can have your tea in this room, and that wOi
Bave you from having to dine with Lady Aahby and Sir
Thomas : which would be rather awkward — at least, ooi
awkward, but rather — a^you know what I mean. I
thought you mightn't like it so well— especially as we tdaj
have other ladJea and gentlemen to dine with us occasionally.*
* Certainly/ said I,'I would much rather have it as you
say, and, if you have no objection, I should prefer having tR
my meals in this room,'
'Why so ?'
* Because, I imagine, it would be more agreeable to ImAj
Ashby and Sir Thomas.'
'Noting of the kind/
'At any rate, it would be more agreeable to me.'
She made some faint objections, but «oon conceded : aad
I could see that the proposal was a considerable relief to ber.
'Now, come into the drawing-room, " said she, • There'*
the dressing bell ; bat I won't go yet : it's no use diBSsing
when there's no one to see yon ; and I want to have a litUe
discourse/
The drawing*room was certainly an imposing apartmsD^
and very elegantly furnished ; but I saw its young niu i hfT il
glance tow & rds me aa we entered, as if to notice how I vh
impressed by the spectacle, and acoordingly T determined lo
preeerve va aspect of stony indi0erenoe, as if I saw nothing
at all remarkable. But this was only for & mosHOl:
immediately conscience whispered, * Why should I disappohn
bor to save my pride ? No — rather let me sacrifiee my pride
to gire ber a little innocent gratification/ And I bones^y
looked round, and (old her it was a noble room, and Tscy
taatefulty famished. She said little, but I ww thm mi

however, she would not give me time to examine, but, saying
I must look at them some other day, insisted upon my
admiring the little j & welLed watch ehe ha^ purchased in
Geneva ; and then she took me round the room to point out
sundry articles of vtrtn she had brought from Italy; an
elegant little timepiece, and several busts, small graceful
figures, and vases, all beautifully carved in white marble.
She spoke of these with animation, and heard my admiring
comments with a smile of pleasure ; that soon, however,
vanished, and wag followed by a melancholy sigh : ag if in
consideration of the insufficiency of all such baubles to the
happiness of the human heart, and their woeful inability to
supply its insatitvle demands.
Then, stretching herself upon a couch, she motioned me
to a capa.cious easy-chair that stood opposite — not before the
fire, but before a wide open window ; for it was summer, be
it remembered ; a sweet* warm evening in the latter half of
June, I sat for a moment in silencep enjoying the still, pure
air, and the delightful prospect o£ the park that lay before
me, rich in verdure and foliage, and basking in yellow sun-
shine, relieved by the long shadows of declining day. But I
must bake advantage of this pause : I had inquiries to make,
and, like the substance of a lady's postscript, the most
important must come last. So I began with af;king after
Mr. and Mrs. Murray, and Miss Matilda and the young
gentlemen.
I was bold that papa had the gout, which made him very
ferocious ; and that he would not give up his choice wines,
and bis substantial dinners and suppers, and had quari elled
with his physician, because the latter had dared to say that
no medicine could cure him ivhile he lived bo freely ; that
mamma and thereat were well- Matilda was still wild and
reckless, but she had got a fashionable governess, and was
considerably improved in her mannei's, and soon to be intro-
duced to the world ; and John and Charles (now at home for
the holidays) were, by all accounts, * fine, bold, unruly,
EDiflchievous boys/

^m
AGNES OBEY
* And how are the other people getting on ?'said I-
Greeast, for mstance ?'
* Ah 1 Mr. Green is heart-broken, you know,'replied she^
wifch a languid smile :'he hti & n'fc got over his disappomtnieDl
yet, and never will, I suppose. He a doomed to be an obi
bachelor ; ai^d his sisters are doing their best to get mafd^'
* And the Melthams ?'
'Oh, they're jogging on as usual, I suppose : but I hicnt
very little about any of them — except Harry/ said sb^
blushiDg slightly, and smiling again.'I saw a great deal d
him while we were in London ; for, as soon ae he beArd wi
were there, he came up under pretence of visiting his brother,
and dither followed me^ like a shadow, wherever I went, or
met me, like a rofloction, at every turn. You needn't look
BO shocked, Miss Grey ; I was very discreet, I aesure you :
butj you know, one can't help being admired. Poor fellow!
He was not my only worshipper ; though he waa certainly
the most conspicuous, and, I think, the most devoted EunOfig
them all. And that deteatEible — ahero — and Sir Thomjia
chose to take oflfence at him — or my profuse expenditure, or
something — I don't exactly know what — and hurried me
down to the countiy at a moment^s notiDe ; wheiB I'm to

And she bit her lip, and frowned vindictively upon the
fair domain she had once so coveted to call her own.
'And Mr* Hatfield,'said I^ * what is become of him ?'
Again she brightened up, and answered gaily —'Oh ! he
made up to an elderly spinster, and marned her, not long
since ; weighing her heavy, purse against her faded charma,
and expecting to find that solace in gold which wia dsoied
him in love — ha, ha f'
* Well, and I think that's all— except Mr. Weston : vbt

'I don't know, I'm sure. He's gone from Horton.*
'How long since ? and where is he gone to ?'

'except that he went about a month ago^I ue^er 9Akd

where'(T would hav & asked whether it waa to a living or

people nnwie a great rout a* > otit his leaving,* continued she,
* much to Mr, Hatfield's displeasure ; for Hatfield didn't
like him, because he had too much influence with the
common people, and because he was not suflficiently tract-
able and submissive to hirn — and for some other unpardon-
able sins, i don't know what. But now I positively must go
and dress : the second bell will ling directly, ixnd it I come
to dinner in this guise, I shall never hear the end of it
from Lady Ashby. It's a strange thing one can^t he
mistress in one's own house I Just ring the belli and Til
send for my maid, and tell them to get you Bomo tea. Only
think of that intolerable woman —'
Who— your maid ?'
No ; — my mother-in-law — -and my unfortunate mistake I
nslead of letting her take heraelf off to some other house, as
she offered to do when I mamed, I was fool enough to ask
her to live here atillj and direct the affairs of the house for
me ; because, in the first place, I hoped we should spend
the greater part of the year in town, and in the second
place, being so young and inexperienced, I was frightened at
the idea of having a houseful of servants to manage, and
dinners to order, and parties to entertain, and all the rest of
it, and I thought she might assist me with her experience ;
never dreaming she would prove a usurper, a. tyrant, an
incubus, a spy, and everything else that's detestable^ I
wish she was dead I'
Bhe then turned to give her orders to the footman, who
had been standing bolt upright within the door for the last
half minute, and had heard the latter part of her animad^
versions ; and, of course, made his ov^n reflections upon
them, notwithstanding the inflexible, wooden countenanoa
he thought proper to preserve in the drawing*room. On my
remarking aftei-wards that he must have heard her, she
replied — * Oh, no matter f I never care about the footmen ;
they're mete automatons : it's nothing to them what their

stipenors say or do ; they won't dure to repeat it ; and as to
whfti they think^if they prasumc to think at all — of course,
nobodj eaerm for that. It would be a pretty thing indeed,
«e were fco be tongue-tied by our Bsrvants ! *
80 Bftyizig, she hld off to make her hasty toilet, leAi
tne (o pilot my way back to my sitting-room, where, m due
time, I was served with a cup of tea. After that, I eit
musing oa Lftdy Ashby^s paat and present condition; nod
on whfti Httle information I bad obtained respecting Mr
Wostoii, & Dd the small chance there vr & ^ of ever seeing or
baaritig anything more of htm throughout my quiet, drab-ecionr
fife : which, henceforth, seemed to offer no alternative between
poeitiTe r & Lny days^ and days of dull giey clouds wilhoat
dcwnfall. At length, however, I began to weary of my
thoogfats, and to wish I knew where to find the Library my
lioaetees had spoken of ; and to wonder whether I was lo
remain there doing nothing till bedtime. jH
As I was not rich enough to possess a watch, I could noff
tail how time was pAesing, except by observing the slowly
lengthening shadows from the window; which pnoseoted a
side view, including a corner of the park, a clump of trees
whoso topmost branches had been colonised by an innumer-
ahta oompany of noisy rooks^ and a hig)^ wafl with a nuBS-
Iro wooden gate : no doubt communicabing with the stable-
yard, as a broad carriage-road swept up to it front the park.
Th*i shadow of this wall soon took posesssion of the whole
of the ground as far as I could see, forcing the golden son-
light to retreat inch by inch, and at last take refuge in the
very tops of the trees. Ere long, even they were left in
shadow— the shadow of the distant hills, or of the earth itself
and, in sympathy for the busy citizens of the rookery,
fflgrolled to see their habitation, so lately bathed in glori <
ligbt* reduced to the sombre, work-a-day hue of the lo^
iPIOrld. or of my own world within. For a moment, bi

departed. Twilight came stealing on ; the rooks became
more quiet ; I became more " weary, and wished I were going
home to-morrow. At length it grew dark ; aud I waa think-
ing of ringing for a candle, and betaking myself to bed,
when my hostess appeared, with many apologies for having
neglected me so long, and laying all the blame upon that
'nasty old woman/ as she called her mother-in-law,
* If I didn't sit with her in the drawing-room while Sir

forgive me * and then, if I leave the room the instant he cornea
— as I have done once Oi* twice^it is an unpardonable offence
against her dear Thomas. She never showed such disrespeot
to her husband ; and as for afTdcUon, wives never think of

CHAPTER XXin
THE PARK
I CAME down a little b & fore eight, next mamingp as I knew
by the striking of a distant clock. There waa no appearanoa
of breakfast. I waited above an hour before it came, BtiLl
vainly longing for acceaa to the library ; and, after that
lonely repast was conduded, I waited again about an hour
and a half in great suspense and discomfort, uncertain what
to do. At length Lady Aahby came to bid me good-moming.
She informed me she had only just breakfasted, and now
wanted me to take an early walk with tier in the park. She
asked bow long I had been up, and on receiving my answer,
expressed the deepest regret, and again promised to show
me the library. I suggested she had better do so at once,
and then there would be no further trouble either with
remembeiing or forgetting. She complied, on condition that
I would not think of reading, or bothering vdbh the books
DOW ; for ehe wanted to show me t]:ie gardens, and take a
walk in the park with me, before it beoame too hot for enjoy-
ment ; whichj indeed, was nearly the case already* Of course
I readily assented ; and we took our walk accordingly.
As we were strolling in the park, talking of what my
companion had seen and heard during her travelling experi-
ence, a gentleman on horgeback rode up and passed us. Aa
he turned, in passing, and stared me full in the face, I had a
good opportunity of seeing what he was hke. Ho waa tall,
thin, and wasted, with a slight stoop in the shoulders, a pale
face, but somewh^tt blotchy, and disagreeably red about the
eyelids, plain feutureBr and a general appearance of languor

I
AGNES GREY
and flatneBB^ relieved by Eh ainiBber expression in the month
a.nd the dull, soulless eyes.
'I detest that man t'whispered Lady Asbby, with bitter
emphasis, as he slowly trotted by.
'Who is it ? * I asked^ unwiihng to suppose ihftt tht
should so speak of ber husband.
'Sir Thomas Asbby/ she replied, with di^eary compo-
sure.
'And do you detest bim. Misa Murray?'said I, for I wu
too much shocked to remember her name at the momeni.
'Yes, I dOj Miss Grey, and despise him too ; and if yen ^
knew hiro you would not blame me.'fl
* But yon knew what he was before you married him/
'No ; I only thought so : I did not half know him really.
I knew you warned me against it, and I wish I ba4 lisletied fl
to you : but it s too late to regret that now. Aod besides, ™
mamma ought to have known better than either o£ us, and
she never said anything against it— quite the contrary. And
then I thought he adored me, and would let me have my
own way ; he did pretend to do so at first* but bow he do^
BOt oare a bit about me. Yet I should not care for that : be
might do as he pleased, if I might only be free to amoae
myself and to stay in London, or have a few friends down
here : but he teill do as he pleases, and I must be a piisoiLer
and a slave. The moment he saw I oould enjoy myself with-
out him, and that others knew my value better than himadl,
the selfish wretch began to accuse me of coquetry and
extravagance ■ and to abuse Hany Meltham, whose shoes he
was not worthy to clean. And then he must needs have HM
down in the country, to lead the hfe of a nun, lest I should
dishonour hixn or bring him to ruin ; as if he had not beeo
ten times worse every way, with his betting-book, and hii
gamingtable, and his opera-girls, and his Lady This and
Mrs, That— yes, and his bottles of wine, and glasses d
brandy-and*water tool Oh, I would give ten ihouiafij
worlds to be Mhs Murray again t It is too bad to feel life,

each a brute as that I'exclaimed she, fairly bursting into
tears in the bitterDesa of her vexation.
Of course, I pitied her ei[ce6 < iirgly ; ^ veil for her false
idea of tuippinesa and disregard of duty, as for the wretched
partner with whom her fate was linked. I said what I could
to con^fort her, and offered such counsels as I thought she
most required : advising her, first, by gentle reasoning, by
kindnesBi example, and persuasion, to try to ameliorate her
husband ; and then, when she had done all she could, if she
still found him incorrigible, to endeavour to abstract herself
from him — to wrap herself up in her own integrity, and
trouble herself as little about him as possible. I exhorted
her to seek consolation in doing her duty to God and man,
to put her trust in Heaven, and solace herself with the care
and nurture of her little daughter ; assuring her she would
be amply rewarded by witnessing its progress in strength and
wisdom, and receiving its genuine affection,
*But 1 cau*t devote myself entirely to a child/ said she ;
* it may die — which ia not at ail improbable/
'But, with care, many a delicate infant has become a
strong man or woman.'
'But it may grow so intolerably like its father that I
shall hate it.'
'That is not likely; it ia a little giil, and strongly
resembles its mother.*
'No matter ; I should like it better il it were a boy— only
that its father will leave it no inhentance that he can possibly
squander away. What pleasure can I have in aetiing a girl
grow up to eclipee me, and enjoy those pleasures thai 1 am
for ever debarred from ? But supposing I could be so
generous as to take delight in this, still it is only a child ;
and I oan't centre all my hopes in a child : that is only one
degree better than devoting oneself to a dog, And as for
all the wisdom and goodness you have been trying to instil
into me—'that is all very right and proper, I daresay, and if
I were some twenty years older, I might fi-uctify by it:
but people must enjoy themselves when they are young;

544
AGNES GKEY
ftnd if others won't let ihem- — why, they must h & te theoi
for it 1'
'The best w & y to enjoy yourself ia to do what is right
and bate nobody. The end of Eellgion is not to teach oi
bow to die* but how to live ; and the earlier you become wise
and good, the more of happiness you secure. And no^,
Lady Ashby, I have one more piece of advice to offer you^
which is, thopt you will not make an enemy of your mother-
in-law. Don't get into the way of holding her at anna'
lengthy and regarding her with jealous distrust I neTersaw
her, but I have heard good aa well as evil respecting her ;
and I imagine that, though cold and haughty in ber gaoenl
demeanour, and even exacting in her requirements, she has
strong affections for those who can reach them ; and, though
BO blindly attached to her son, slie is not withoat good^
principles, or incapable of hearing reason. If you would bnt^l
concihata her a little, and adopt a friendly, open manner—^
and even confide your grievances to ber — real grievances, such
as you have a right to cocDplain of — it is my linn belief that
she would, in tima, become your faithful friend, and a comfort
and support to you, instead of the incubus you describe her/
But I fear my advice had little effect upon the unfortu-
nate young lady ; and, finding I could render myself soliiilB
serviceable, my residence at Ashby Park became doubly
paiufuL But Btill^ I must stay out that day and the following
one, aa I hod promised to do so : though, resisting all
entreaties and inducenieuta to prolong my visit further, I
insisted upon departing the next morning ; affirming thai
my mother would be lonely without tne, and th & t she
impatiently expected my return. Nevertheless, it was with
a heavy heart that I bade adieu to poor Lady Aahby, and
left her in her princely home. It was no slight additional
proof of her unhappiness^ that she should so ding to the con-
solation of my presence, and earnestly desire the company
of one whose general tastes and ideas were so little cougeniat
to her owu^whom she had completely forgotten in her hour
of prosperity, and whose presence would be rather a nuisance
than a p\e^MLt & , \i %b^ could h^t have h^f her beta's deei^
CHAPTER XXrV
TEB SANDS
OuB school was not situated in the hea^ of the town : on
entering A from the north -weat there U a. row of respect-
able-looking houseB > on each gide of the broa^r white road,
with narrow slips of garden-ground before them, Venetian
blinds to the windows, and a flight of steps leading to each
trim, brass-handled door. In one of the largest of these
habitations dwell my mother and I, with such young ladies
ftfl our friends and the public choBe to commit to our charge,
Consequently, we were a considerable distance from the sg & ^
and divided from it by a Labyrinth of streets and houses.
But the sea was my deUght; and I would often gladly
pierce the town to obtain the pleasure of a walk beside it,
whether with the pupils, or alone with my mother during
the vacations. It was deUghtful to me at all times and
seasonSj but especially in the wild commotion of a rough
oea-breeze, and in thB brilliant freahne^s of a summer
morning.
I awoke early on the third morning after ray return from
Ashby Park — the sun was shining Uirough the blind, and I
thought how pleasant it would be to pass through the quiet
town and take a solitary ramble on the sands while half the
world was in bed. I was not long in forming the resolution,
DOr slow to aot upon it. Of course I would not disturb my
mother, so I stole noiselessly downstairs, and quietly
unfastened the door. I was dressed and out, when the
church clock struck a quarter lo six. There was a fe*jling of
d vigour iu the very streets ; and when I got
C46
AGNES GEEY
free of the town^ when my footway an the sands and my & ai
towards the broad^ bright bay, no language can describe tba
effect o£ the deep, dear azure of tbesky and oceaa, the bnght
nioraing sunshine on the semicircular barrier of craggy cHSi
giimaounted by green swelling hills, and on the aoaooth,
wide sands, and the low rocks out at sea^— lookuig, with
their clothing of weeds and moss^ like little grasa-grown
islands — and above att, on the brilliant, sparkling wbtbb.
And then, the unspeakable purity and freshness of theairl
There was just enough heat to enhance the value of the
breeze, and just enough wind to keep the whole sea in
motion, to make the waves come bounding to the shore,
foaming and sparkling, as if wild with glee. Nothing daft
was stirring — no living creafcure was visible besides myselL
My footsteps were the firat to press the firm, unbroken
Bands ; — nothing before had ti-ampled them since last night'8
flowing tide had obliterated the deepest marks of yesterday,
and left them fair and even, except w^here the subsiding
water had left behind it the braces of dimpled pools ^nd htUe
running streams.
Refreshed, delighted, invigorated^ I walked along» forget-
ting all my care;^, feeling as if I had wings to my feet, and
could go at least forty miles without fatigue, and expenend-
ing a sense of exhilaration to which I had been an entire
fitranger sinoe the days of early youth. About half-past
six, however, the grooms began to come down to air thetr
masters'horses — first one, and tlien another, till there were
some dozen hoi*seB and five or six riders : but that need not
trouble me, for they would not come as far as the tow rocks
which I was now approaching. When I had reached these,
and walked over the moist, slippery sea-weed (at the risk of
tiounderuig into one of the numerous pods of dear, salt
water that lay between them), to a little mossy promoQtorj
with the sea splashing round it, I looked back again to we
w^ho next was stirring. Still, there were only the eari|
grooms with their horses, and one gentletnaa wilh & liub
dark speck of a dog running before him, and onei
AGNES GREY
sa
r
coming out of the town to get water for the imths. In
another minute or two, the diatant bathing machines would
begin to move, and then the elderly gentlemen of regular
habits and sober quaker ladies would be coming to take their
salutary morning walks. But however interesting guch ^
scene might be, I could not wait to witness it, for the sun
and the sea so dazzled my eyes in that direction, that I could
but afford one glance ; and then I turned again to delight
myself with the sight and the sound of the sea dashing
against my promontory — with no prodigious force^ for the
swell waa broken by the tangled sea-weed and the unseen
rocks beneath ; othei'wise I should hoou have been deluged
with spray. But the tide was coming in ] the water was
rising ; the gulfs and lakes were filling ; the straits were
widening : it was time to seek some safer footing ; so I walked,
skipped, and stumbled back to the smooth, wide sands, and
resolved to proceed to a certain bold projection in the oli£Es,
d then return-
Presently, I heard a snuffling sound behind me and then
a dog came frisking and wriggling to my feet. It was my
own Snap — the little dark, wire-h^ured terrier I When I
spoke his name^ he leapt up in my fiice and yelled for joy.
Almost as much dehghted as himself, I caught the little
creature in my arms, and kissed him repeatedly. But how
came he to be there ? He could not have dropped from the
sky, or come all that way alone : it must be either his master,
the rat-catcher, or somebody else that had brought him ; so,
repressing my extravagant caresses, and endeavouring to
repress his likewise, I looked round, and beheld^Mr. Weston !
'Your dog remembers you well, Mins Groy/ said he,
warmly grasping the hand I offered him without clearly
knowing what I was about.'You rise early.'
'Not often so early as this,'I replied, with amiizing com-
posure, considering all the circumstances of the case,
* How far do you purpose to extend your walk ?'
'I was thinking of roturuing — it must bo almost time, I
thmk/

648
AGNES GREY
He consulted hi^ watch— a gold one now — and told
waa only five minutes past seven.
'But, doubUeas, you have had a long enough walk/ aud
he, turning towards the town, to which I now prooeedfid
leisurely to retrace my steps ; and he walked beside me.
* In what part of the town do you live ? * aeked he.
never could diM < ;over.'
Never could disooves* ? Had he endeavoured tc do so
then ? I told him the place of our abode. He asked bow w«
prospered m our affdrs, I told him we were doing very
well — that we had had a considerable addition to our pupils
after the Chrietmae vacation, and expected a still fortl^
increase at the close of this^
* You must be an accomplished instructor,'he obfiorved.
^ NOp it is my mother/ I replied;'she manages ^lingt
so well, and is so active, and clever, and kind.'
'I should like to know your mother. Will you introduce
me to her some time, if I call ?'
'Yes, Willingly.'
'And will you allow me the privilege of an old friend,
looking in upon you now and then? *
* Yes, a — I suppose so.'
This was a very foolish answer, but the truth was, I eon
sidsred that I had no right to invite anyone to my motfaor'v
house without hor knowledge ; and if I had said,'Yes, if my
mother docs not object/ it would appear as if by hisquesdon
I understood more than was expected ; bo, supposing shfl
would not, I addod, * I suppose so :'but of course I should
have said something more sensible and more polite, if I hid
had my wits about me. We continued our walk for a minate
in silence; which, however, was shortly relieved (no small
relief to me) by Mr, Weston commenting upon the hrighttMi
of the morning and the beauty of the bay, and then upon the
advantages A — - possessed over many other fasbiouafali
places of resort.
* You don't ask what brings me to A ,'said he.'You
can't suppose I*m rich enough to come for my own pleasura'

§ * I expect to like my parish better a year or two hence,
when I have worked certain reforms I have set my heart
upon^ — or, at l@ast, progressed some steps towards such an
achievement. But you may congratulate me now ; for I find
it very agreeable to have a parish all to myself, with nobody
to interfere with me — to thwai-t my plana or cripple my exer-
tions : and besides, I have a respectable houae in a rather
pleasant neighbourhood, and three hundred pounda a year;
and, in fact, I have nothing but solitude to complain of, and
nothing but a companion to wish for/
He looked at me as he concluded : and the flat^h of his
dark eyes seemed to set my face on tire ; greatty to my own
discomfiture, for to evince confusion at such a juncture was
intolerable. I made an effort, therefore, to remedy the evil,
and disclaim all personal application of the remark by a
hasty, ill-Bxpreased reply, to the effect that, if he waited till
he was woU known in the neighbourhood, he might ha^^a
numerous opportunities for supplying his want among the
residents of F and its vicinity, or the visitors of A ,
if he required so ample a choice : not considering the com-
pliment implied by such an aseertionj till his answer made
me aware of it.
'I am not so presumptuous as to believe that/ said he,
'though you tell it me; but if it were bo, I am rather
pEirticular iu my notions of a companion for life, and perhaps
I might not find one to suit me among the ladies you

'If you requiro perfecfeion^ you nevsr will.*
* I da not — I have no righfe to require it, as beiD|
from perfect myself.'
Hero the con\'ersatioD was intemipted by a water-csri
lumbering past us, for we were now come to the busy part of
tho Bands ; and, for the next eight or ten miDUtes, between
caxtB and horses, and asses, and men, there was little roocn
for aociul intercourse, till we had turned our backs upon the
sea, and begun to ascend the precipitous road leading into
the town. Here my companion offered me his arm^ which I
accepted, though not with the intention of using it as a
support.
* You don't often come on to the sands, I think,* said ha
*for I have walked there many times, both morning and
evening, since I csrme, and never seen you till now; and
several times, in pasBing through tho town, too^ I have looked
about for your school — ^but I did not think of the Boad ;
and oncG or twice I made inquiries, but without obtaining
Uie requisite information.'
When we had surmotinfced the acclivity, I was about to
withdraw my arm from his, but by a slight tighteniog of the
elbow was tacitly informed that such was not his will, and
accordingly desisted. Discoui*sing on different subjectdi we
entered the town, and passed through several streets, I saw
tbab he was going out of his way to accompany me, uotwith*
standing the long walk that was yet before him ; and, fearin g^
that he might be inconveniencing himself from n^otives o^H
politeness, I observed —'I fear I am taking you out of your
way, Mr, Weston—I believe the road to F lies quite in
another direction/

* And when will you come to see maruma ?'
'To-morrow — God willing.'
The end of the next street was nearly the ooncludoa'
of my Journey- He stopped there, however, bid ma

doubtful whGther to follow bis old mistresa or hk new

latter.
'I won't offer to restore him to you, Miss Grey/ said Mr.
Weston, smiling,'because I like him.'
'Oh, I don't want him,'replied I,'now that he has a
good master ; I'm quite satisfied.'
'You take it for granted that I am a good one, then ?'
The man and the dog departed, and I returned home, fuU
of gratitude to heaven for bo much bliss, and praying that
my hopes might not again be crushed.

I've heard you speak of Mr. H & lfield. "
'Mr. Hatiieid w & s the reotor, and Mr. Westoa the
curate : I used to meuiii^ii him Bometjimea in coatradiatinctioa
to Mr. Horlfield, as being a mors efQcient clargyman. How-
ever, he was oa the sands this morning with tha dog— he
had bought it, I auppoae, from the r & t-catGher ; and he
knew me as well as ifc did — probably tbmugh its means : and
I had a little conversation with him, in the course of which,
as be aaked about our school, I was led to say something
about you, and your good management ; and he said he
should hke to know you, and asked if I would introduae
him to you, if he should take the liberty of calling tc-morrow ;
eo I said I would. Was I right?'
I'Of course. What kind of a man is he?'
* A very respectabU man, I think : bub you will see him
to-morrow* He is the new vicar of F , and as he hsts
only been there a few weeks, I suppose ha haa made no
friends yet, and wan & a a little society/
The morrow came. What % fever of anxiety and
expectation I was in from breakfast till noon — at which
time he made hta appearance I Having introduced him
to my mother, I took my work to the window, and sat
down U > awibit the result of the interview. They got on
extremely well together — greatly to my satisfaction, for I
bard felt very anxious about what my moLher would think of
him. He did not Btay Long that time : but when he rose to
take leave^ she said she should be happy to see him, when-
ever he might find it convenient to call again ; and when he
waa gone, I was gratified by hearing her say^^ —'Well ! I
think he's a very sensible man. But why did you sit back
there^ Agnes,'she added, * and talk bo little ?'
'Because you talked so well, mamma, I thought you
required no assistance from me : and^ besides, he was your
visitor, not mine.'
After that, be often called upon us — several times in the
course of a week. He generally addressed most of hia
coaveriiation to my mother : p,ud no woud^r^ for she could

AGNES GREY

converse. I almost envied the unfettered, vigorous Anency
of her diBooui^se, and Ihe strong sense evinced by averyUiiiLg
aha soid^Emd yet, I did not ; for, though I oocaaionaily
regratted my own deticienclea for hia aake, it gave ma rery
groat pleaatire to sit and h^^ar the tvo beings I lovad aad
honoured above evei^ one else in the'world, dieooniEiag
together so amicEibly, fio wisely, and so welL I was not
always silent^ however ; nor waa I at all nt^leated. I wia
quite aa much noticed as I would wish to be : ther@ wb« oo
lack of kind words and kinder looks, no end of delicate
attentions, too ^e and subtle to be grasped by worda, and
therefore indescribable — but deeply felt at ha & ri.
Ceremony was quickly dropped between us : Mr. Wenton
came as an expectad guest, welooiue at all times* and D£ver
deranging the economy of our household afifaii^. He eren
called cna'Agnes:'the name had been timidly spoken At
fii-st, but, finding it gave no oSenoe in any quarter, he seemed
greatly to prefer that appellation to * Miss Grey ;'and so did
I, How tedious and gloomy were those days in wluch be
did not come t And yet not miserable ; for I had still lbs
remembrance of the last visit and the hope of the naxt lo
cheer me. But when two or three days passed with^iut m]
seeing him. I certainly felt very anxious — abwirdly. un-'
reasonably so ; for, of course, he had his own busiusss and
the affairs of his pansh to attend to. And I dreaded the
close of the holidays, when my business also would be^int
and ] should be sometimes unable to see him, and soma-
times — when my mother was in the schoolroom — obliged to
be with him alone : a position I did not at ^1 desire, in the
house ; though to meet him out of doors, luid walk beside
him, had proved by no means disagreeable.
One evening, however, in the last week of the vacatioii,
he arrived — unexpectedly : for a heavy and protrsifitMi
thunder- shower during the afberuoon had almost dastrpyad
my hop€a of seeing him that day ; but now the stonn waa
over, and the sun was Bhiuiug brightly.

was moat delightful. Mr. Weabon would have me to take his

abstracted. I wondered what was the matber, and felt an
indefinite dread that aomething unpleasant was on his mind ;
and vague surmises, concerning what it might be, troubled
me not a little, and made me grave and silent enough. But
these fantasies vanished upon reaching the quiet outskirts
j of the town ; for as soon as we came within sight of the
venerable old ehurch, and the hill, with the deep blue
sea beyond it, I found my companion was cheerful enough.
|l'I'm afraid I've been walking too fast for you, Agnes/ said
he :'in my impatience to be rid of the town, I forgot to
consult your convenience ; but now we'll walk as slowly as
you please. I see, by those light clouds in the west, there
will be a brilliant sunset, and we shall be in time to witness
its effect upon the eea, at the m < xi iDOdemte rate of
progression/
When we had got about half-way up the hill, we feU into
fiilence again ; which, as usual, he was the first to break.
'My house is desolate yet. Miss Grey/ he smilingly
obeenred,'and I am acquainted now with all the ladies in
my parish, and several in this town too ; and many others I
know by sight and by report ; but not one of them will suit

me tor a oompanion ; in fact, there is oaly one person in iha
world that will : and that 1b yourself ; and I w & nt to know
your decision ?'
'Are you ia eameatp Mr. Weston ? *
* In eojueat 1 How could you think I should jest on such
a subject?'
He laid hia hand on mine, that rested on hi & arm ; he
miLflt have felt it tremble — but it waa no great matter now.
'I hope I have not been too precipitate,'he said, in a
serious tone.'You must have known that it was not my
way to flu.tter and talk soft nonsense, or e^'^en to speak the
admiration that I felt ; and that a single word or ghuioe of
mine infant more than the honied phrases and fervent
protestations of most other men.'■
I said something about not hkiiig to leave my mother^ and
doing nothing without her consent.
•I settled everything with Mrs* Grey, while you were
putting on your bonnet/ replied he.'She said I might havd
her eonsentj if I could obtain yours ; and I aaked her, in
case I should be so happy, to come and live with na— for I
waa sure you would like it better. But she refused, saying
she could now afford to employ an assistant, sijod would
continue the school till she could purchase an annnisj
sufficient to maintain her in comfortable lodgings ; and,
meantime, she would spend her vacations alternately with
us and your sister, and should be quite contented if you w^ re
hsf^y. And so now I have overruled your objections on her
acooant. Have yon any other ?'
'No — none/
'You love me then ?'said he, fervently presaing
hand.
'Yes/

Here I pause. My Diary, from which I have oomj
these pages, goes but little fuiiher. 1 could go on for jeut,

forget that glorious summer evening, and always remember
with delight that steep hill, and the edge of the precipice
where we stood together, watching the splendid sunset
mirrored in the restlBSS world of waters at our feet— with
hearts fitlad with gratitude to heaven, and happineaa, and
love — almost too full for speoch.
A few weeks after that, when my mother had supplied
hereelf with an ageietant, I became the wife of Edward
Weston ; and never have found cause to repent it, and am
certain that I never ahalh We have had trials, and we know
thai WG must have them again ; but WB boar them well
together, and endeavour to fortify ourselvea and each other
against the final aeparation^that greatest of all afflietionB to
the survivor^ But, if wo keep in miud the glorious heaven
boyond, where both may meet again^ and Bin and sorrow are
unknown, surely that too may be borne ; and, meantime^ we
endeavour to live to the gloiy of Him who has scattered ao
many blcBBings in our path.
Edwardj by hia strenuous exertions, has worked Burpria-
ing reforms in his parish, and m esteemed and loved by its
inhabitants — as he deserves ; for whatever his faults may bo
as a man (and no one is entirely without), I defy anybody to
blame him as a pastor^ a husband, or & fabher.
Our children, Edward, Agnes, and little Mary, promise
well ; their education, for the time being, is chiefly committed
to me ; and they shall want no good thing that a mother b
care can give. Our modest income is amply sufficient for
our requirements : and by practising the economy we learnt
in harder times, and never attempting to imitate our richer
neighbours, we manage not only to enjoy comfort and con*
tentment ourflelvee, but to have every year something to
lay by for our children, and something to give to ihose who
need it.
And DOW I think I have said BuflScieut.
