INTRODUCTION
TO
JANE EYRE
'Jans Eyrs* was first published in October 1847. ^
a century — since this tale of the North by an unknown wri
stole upon London, and, in the very midst of the serial pd
cation of * Vanity Fair/ took the town by storm, obtaining
its authbr in the course of a few weeks a success which,
the creator of Becky Sharp afterwards said to her, a lit
sadly and sharply, *it took me the work of ten years
achieve.*
Half a century, in the view of the Roman Church, is of
hardly sufficient to decide even the first step in the proc
of canonisation ; it b generally amply sufficient to decide
matters of literary rank and permanence. How has the 1
diet gone in the case of Currer Bell ? Have these fifty yc
* cut all meaning from the name,* or have they but fille <
with a fuller content, wreathed it with memories and asso
tions that will for ever keep it luminous and delightful ai
the dim tracts of the past? ^^ " " ^^^
Judging by the books that have been written and read
recent years, by the common verdict as to the Bront€ sbt
their story, and their work, which prevails, almost without
ception, in the literary criticism of the present day; by
tone of personal tenderness, even of passionate homage
which many wnt^ speak of Charlotte and of Emily ; and
the increasing recognition which their books have obtaii

X JANE EYRE
abroad, one may say with some confidence that the name and
memory of the Brontes were never more alive than now, that
'Honour and Fame have got about their graves'for good
and all, and that Charlotte and Emily Bronte are no less
secure, at any rate, than Jane Austen or George Eliot or
Mrs. Browning of literary recollection in the time to come.
But if the Brontes live, their books live also. There are
some names of the past — Byron — Voltaire — that are far
greater now, more full of magic and of spell, than the
books associated with them — that are, in fact, separable
from the books, and could almost live on without them. But
Charlotte Bronte if Jane Eyre and Lucy Snowe. You can-
not think of her apart from what she has written, and every-
thing that she wrote has the challenging quality of personal
emotion or of passion, moving in a narrow range among very
concrete things, and intimately fused throughout with the in-
cidents and feelings of one small, intense experience : so that,
if one finds, as one does find abundantly, that the Brontes are
remembered, it must be that their books arc read, that people
still sit up into [he night with'Jane Eyre,'and are still as
angry as they were at the first, that they can get no one to
assure tbem of Paul Emmanuel's safe return.
So it roust be ; and so, iudeed, the personal experience of
most of us can vouch that it is. Nevertheless, here and
there one roay hear a protesting voice. Here and there a
reader — and generally a reader of more subtlety and range
than his fellows— struck with the union of certain extrava-
gances and certain dogmatisms in Charlotte Bronte's work,
with the weakness of Anne's and the crudity of Emily's, will
dare to say,'Not at all t The vitality of the Bronti fame
docs not mean primarily the vitality of the Bronte books. It
is a vitality which springs from the English love of the pa-
thetic and the picturesque, and the English tendency to sub-
ordinate matters of art to matters of sentiment. Mrs. Gas-
kell, herself an accomplished novelist, wrote an account of
these lonely girls on a Yorkshire moor, struggling with pov-
erty and consumption, developing genius in the very wrestle
with death, taking the heaven of fame by violence, and per >

ishing in the effort. She showed them to us oppressed by
poverty and by daily contact with a vicious brother, and yet,
through it all, remaining dutiful, loving, and virtuous, as the
good English public likes them to be: she describes the
deaths — the piteous deaths— -of two of the sisters in the very
moment, or on the very threshold, of success, and, finally, her
narrative brought us to the death of Charlotte herself—
Charlotte snatched from happiness and from motherhood,
after one brief year of married life : and so skilful is the tell-
ing, so touching the story, that the great English heart goes
out to it, and forthwith the Bront€ books must be books of
genius, because the BrontSs are so interesting and their story
so tragic.*
Perhaps this explanation is put forward to account rathier
for the continuance of the Bront€s'fame than for their origi-
nal success. Such a critic would admit that'Jane Eyra'
is at least a vivid and exciting story; that'Villette'has at
least passages of extraordinary brilliance: but he will obsti-
nately maintsun, none the less, that other books, now foigot-
ten, have had as much, and that the Bront€ Megend'has
unfairly strengthened the claim of the Bront€ stories upon
posterity.
Let us see how such a contention stands in the case of
* Jane Eyre.* * Jane Eyre *-^o run through a summary of
the plot — is the story of an orphan girl, reared at a Charity
School amid many hardships, going out into the world as a
governess, and falling in love with her employer, Mr. Roch-
ester. She yields herself to her own passion and to his
masterful love-making with an eager, an over-eager abandon-
ment The wedding-day is fixed ; the small marriage party
assembles. But in the very church, and at the moment of
the ceremony, it is revealed to Jane Eyre that Mr. Rochestei
has a wife living, a frenxied lunatic who has been confined
for months in a comer of the same house where she and
Rochester have had their daily dwelling; that Rochestei
^ ] has deliberately entrapped her, and that she stands on the
[ edge of an abyss. The marriage party breaks up in confu-
sion; and Rochester*s next endeavour b to persuade the

P* •'s, felt any deep resentment of his conduct. Neverthe-

^ *• an Evangelical clergyman possessed with a fanatical en-
* " Usiasm for missionary life, observes the girl's strong and
'tiergetic nature, and makes up his mind to marry her, not
■•n tiie least because he loves her, but because he thinks her
Rited to be a missionary's wife. Her will is on the point of
fielding to his, when she hears a mysterious midnight call
from Rochester; she hurries back to her master, to find him
blinded and maimed by the fire which has destroyed his house
and his mad wife together; and of course the end is happiness.
Now certainly there never was a plot, which pretended to
be a plot, of looser texture than that of'Jane Eyre,'It
abounds witb absurdities and inconsistencies. The critics of
Charlotte Bronte's time had no difficulty in pointing them
out ; they lie, indeed, on the surface for all to see. That
such incidents should have happened to Jane Eyre in Mr,
Rochester's house as did happen, without awakening her sus-
picions ; that the existence of a lunatic should have been
commonly known to all the servants of the house, yet wholly
concealed from the governess; that Mr. Rochester should
have been a man of honour and generosity, a man with whom
not only Jane Eyre, but clearly the writer herself, ts in iQve,
and yet capable of deliberately betraying and deceiving a girl
of twenty placed in a singularly helpless position ; — these are
the fundamental puzzles of the story. Mrs. Fairfax is a
mystery throughout. How, knowing what she did, did she
not inevitably know more? — what was her real relation to
Rochester ? — to Jane Eyre ? These are questions that no
one can answer — out of the four comers of the book. The
country-house party is a tissue of extravagance throughout;

INTRODUCTION xiu
the sarcasms and brutalities of the beautiful Miss Ingrain
are no more credible than the manners assumed by the aris-
tocratic Rochester from the beginning towards his ward's
governess, or the amazing freedom with which he pours into
the ears of the same governess — 3, virtuous girl of twenty,
who has been no more than a few weeks under his roof — the
story of his relations with Ad^le*s mother.
Turn to the early scenes, for instance, between Jane and
Rochester. They have been'several days * under the same
roof ; it is Jane's second interview with her employer. Mr.
Rochester, in Sultan fashion, sends for her and her pupil
after dinner. He sits silent, while Jane's quick eye takes
note of him. Suddenly he turns upon hen
'You examine me. Miss Eyre,'said he;'do you think me
handsome?'
Jane, taken by surprise, delivers a stout negative, whereupon
her employer, in caprice or pique, pursues the subject further:
-Criticise me : does my forehead not please you ?*
He lifted up the sable waves of hair which lay horixontally
over his brow, and showed a solid enough mass of intellectuiU
organs, but an abrupt deficiency where the suave sign of benev-
olence should have risen.
'Now, ma'am, am I a fool ?* —
Poor Jane gets out of the dilemma as best she can, and
gradually this astonishing gentleman thaws, becomes conver-
sational and kind. And this is how he puts the little gov-
erness at her ease : —
'You look very much puzzled. Miss E3rre; and though yon
are not pretty, any more than I am handsome, yet a puzded air
becomes you ; besides, it is convenient, for it keeps those search-
ing eyes of yours away from my physiognomy, and busies them
with the worsted flowers of the rug ; so puzzle on. Young lady,
I am disposed to be gr^;arious and communicative to-night.'
* Youfi^ lady^ lam disposed to he ^egarious and tom$Hunuar

this. Parody has nothing to add.

INTRODUCTION xv
And so on. The whole scene from beginning to end is a
piece of heavy grotesque, without either the truth or the fun
of good satire. It was these pages, of course, and certain
others like them in the book, that set George Henry Lewes
preaching the'mild eyes,'the * truth,* and'finish'of Miss
Austen to the new and stormy genius which had produced
'Jane Eyre/ And one may see, perhaps, in Charlotte's sore-
ness, in the very vehemence that she shows under this particu-
lar criticism, that, secretly, the shaft has gone home. She is,
after all, infinitely shrewd, sensitive, and, in the end, just She
wrote a petulant letter to Mr. Lewes ; but she sent for * Pride
and Prejudice,* which she had never read, and the proba >
bility is that, in spite of a natural antipathy, her quick eye
took note at once of the fineness of stroke that goes to cari-
cature itself in that immortal book ; that she pondered Mr.
Collins and Lady Catharine de Burgh ; and that in the com-
^ parative ease and urbanity which marked the painting of
^ manners in'Shirley,'the influence of her tilt with Lewes
^ counts for something.
t As to the other weaknesses of plot and conception, they
are very obvious and very simple. The * arrangements* l^
which Jane Eyre is led to find a home in the Rivers house-
hold, and becomes at once her uncle's heiress, and the good
angel of her newly discovered cousins ; the device of the
phantom voice that recalls her to Rochester's side ; the fire
f that destroys the mad wife, and delivers into Jane's hands a
i subdued and helpless Rochester ; — all these belong to that
jl more mechanical and external sort of plot-making, which the
■I modern novelist of feeling and passion — as distinguished
I from the novelist of adventure — ^prides himself on renouncing.
To him the painting of a situation like that, say, in Benjamin
Constant's'Adolphe'— infinitely true, and wholly insoluble —
where the writer scorns to apply any coercive framework,
any rough-and-ready'plot'to his material, is the admirable
^ < ^ and important thing. The true subject of * Jane Eyre Ms the
courage with which a friendless and loving girl confronts her
own passion, and, in the interest of some strange social in-
stinct which she knows as * duty,* which she cannot explain

iTi JANE EYRE ^
and cao only obey, tramples her love underfoot, and goes
out miserable into the world. Beside this wrestle of the
human will, everything else is trivial or vulgar. The various
expedients — legacies, uncles, fires, and coincidences — by
which Jane Eyre is ultimately brought to happiness, cheapen
and degrade the book without convincing the reader. In
fact — to return to qmj advocatus diaboli —'" Jane Eyre " is on
the one side a rather poor novel of incident, planned on the
ooavenlional pattern, and full oE clumsy execution; on an-
other side it is a picture of passion and of ideas, for which in
tiuth the writer had no sufficient equipment; she moves im-
prisoned, to quote Mr. Leslie Stephen, in " a narrow circle
of thoughts/'if you press it, the psychology of the book is
really childish ; Rochester is absurd, Jane Eyre, in spite uf
the stir that she makes, only half-realised and half-conscious.
Still, as a study of feeling, adapted to some extent to modem
realist demands, the novel came at a happy moment. It is
one of the signs, no doubt, that mark the transition from the
old novel to the new, from Ihe old novel of plot r—A t .', .;

INTRODUCTION xvU
Simply, one might say, Charlotte Bronte herself. Litera-
ture, says Joubert, has been called the expression of society ;
and so no doubt it is, looked at as a whole. In the single
\\ writer, however, it appears rather as the expression of stud-
ies, or temper, or personality. * And this last is the best.
There are books so fine that literature in them is but the
expression of those that write them.'In other words, there
are books where the writer seems to be everything, the mate*
rial employed, the environment, almost nothing. The main
secret of the charm that clings to Charlotte BrontS*s books
is, and will always be, the contact which they give us with
her own fresh, indomitable, surprising personality — surpris-
I ing, above all. In spite of its conventionalities of scheme^
I *Jane Eyre'has, in detail, in conversation, in the painting
[ of character, that perpetual magic of the unexpected which
[ overrides a thousand faults, and keeps the mood of the
^. reader happy and alert The expedients of the plot may irri-
tate or chill the artistic sense ; the voice of the story-tdlert
r ] in its inflections of passion, or feeling or reverie, charms and
holds the ear, almost from first to last The general plan
may be commonplace, the ideas even of no great profundity;
but the book is original. How often in the early scenes of
childhood or school-life does one instinctively expect the
conventional solution, the conventional softening, theHooD-
ventional prettiness or quaintness, that so many other story-
tellers, of undoubted talent, could not have resisted I And
it never comes. Hammer-like, the blows of a passionate
realism descend. Jane Eyre, the little helpless child, is
never comforted ; Mrs. Reid, the cruel aunt, is never sorry
for her cruelties ; Bessie, the kind nurse, is not very kind,
she does not break the impression, she satisfies no instinct
of poetic compensation, she only just makes the story credi-
ble, the reader*s assent possible. So, at Lowood, Helen
Bums is not a suffering angel ; there is nothing consciously
pretty or touching in the wonderful picture of her ; reality,
with its discords, its infinite novelties, lends word and magic
to the passion of Charlotte's memory of her dead sister ; all
is varied, living, poignant, full of the inexhaustible savour ol

INTRODUCTION
madness rises in the heart of our race. The'* realm of faery,**
I ] the most beautiful on earth, is our domsun/ — Idealism, un-
derstood as a life-long discontent ; passion, conceived as an
inner thirst and longing that wears and kills more often than
it makes happy ; a love of home and kindred entwined with
the very roots of life, so that home-sickness may easily ex-
haust and threaten life ; an art directed rather to expres^n
than to form — ^ragged often and broken, but always poignant,
always suggestive, touched with reverie and emotion ; who
does not recognize in these qualities, these essentially Celtic
qualities, the qualities of the Brontes ?
Take this passage from Charlotte*s letter to Miss Nussey,
announcing Emil/s death :
The anguish of seeing her suffer is over; the spectacle of the
pains of death is gone by ; the funeral day is past. We feel the
is at peace. No need now to tremble for the hard frost and the
keen wind. Emily does not feel them. She died in a time of
promise. We saw her uken from life in its prime.
[ Or, again :
I cannot forget Emily's death-day. — It was very terrible. She
was torn, conscious, panting, reluctant, though resolute, out of a
happy life.
Or, take the well-known outburst in * Shirley,* where Char >
lotte, writing in the desolate Haworth home after her sisters*
deaths, turns from the description of Jessy Yorke, to think of
Martha Taylor, Jessy Yorke's original, and of Martha's burial-
day in Brussels :^
But, Jessy, I will write about you no more. This is an automa
evening, wet and wild. There is only one doud in the sky; bat
it curtains it from pole to pole. The wind cannot rest ; it hur-
ries, sobbing, over hills of sullen outline, colourless with twilight
and mist* Rain has beat all day on that church tower —

as she looks down the bare strip of garden to Hawortl
Church — ] ;

— it rises dark from the stony enclosure of its graveyaid j the
aettles, the long grass, and the tombs all drip with wet. This
evening reminds mc too forcibly of another evening some years
ago- a howling, rainy, autumn evening, too, — when certain
who had that day performed a pilgrimage to a grave new-
made in a heretic cemetery, sat near a wood fire on the hearth
of a foreign dwelling. They were rocrry and social, but they
each knew that a gap. never to be hlled, bad been made in their
circle. They kncwtheyhad lostsomcthingwhoseabsencecould
never be quite atoned for, so long as they lived ; and they knew
thai heavy falling rain was soaking into the wet earth which
covered their lost darling; and that the sad, sighing gale was
mourning above her buried head. The fire warmed them : Life
and Friendship yet blessed them: but Jessy lay cold, coffined,
solitary — only the sod screening her from the storm.
These passages surely have the Celtic quality, if ever writ-
ing had. Rapid, yearning, broken speech I — there is no note
more penetrating in our literature.
Then, as to the Celtic pride, the Celtic shyness, the Celtic
endurance, — Charlotte Bronte was rich In thera all. Her
nature loves to give — recoils from gifts. She will owe noth-
ing to anyone ; she half enjoys, half dislikes, the kindnesses
even of her friendly and considerate publisher ; and in society
she will neither be exhibited nor patronised. Nor will she
submit her judgment or taste ; she will swear to no man's
words. Nothing is more curious than to mark the resolute,
and even haughty, independence with which the little coun-
trywoman approached for the first time the literary world and
the celebrities of London. She breaks her shy silence at a
dinner-table crowded with Macready worshippers to denounce
Macready's acting ; when Thackeray comes to see her for
the first time, she herself says,'The giant sate befgre me ; I
was moved to speak to him of some of his shortcomings
(literary, of course) ; one by one the faults came into my
head, and one by one I brought them out and sought some
explanation or defence ;'— so that Mr. Smith, sitting by, may
well describe it as'a queer scene.'She will have nothing
to say to Miss Barrett's poetry ; and when she returns to
Hawortb, she says, with a touch of quiet and confident scortt^

INTRODUCTION
that London people talk a great deal of writers and books
who mean nothing in the country, nothing to England at
large. As to the shyness, it was the torment of both her
physical and mental life. The Celtic craving for solitude,
t the Celtic shrinking from all active competitive exbtence —
they were part of Charlotte's inmost nature, although per*
petually crossed and checked, no doubt, by other influences
driving her to utterance, to production, to sustained effort.
And for endurance— did not her short life, divided between
labour, fame, and calamity, make, first and chief upon all who
knew it, the impression of an unshaken and indomitable
spirit ? The * chainless soul * was hers no less than Emily's^
though she was far saner and sweeter than Emily.
And all three qualities — pride, shrinking, endurance — ore
writ large in her books. With passion added, they an Jane
*!• Eyre and Lucy Snowe. They supply the atmosphere, the
peculiar note, of all the stories. A contempt for mean and
easy living, for common gains, and common luxuries, breathes
in them, and makes them harsh and bracing as the air of her
own moors.
And one other Celtic quality there is in Charlotte BrontS
and her books, which is responsible perhaps for half their
defects. It b a quality of exuberance, of extravagance, of
what her contemporaries called'bad taste.'Charles Kings-
ley threw'Shirley'aside because the opening seemed to him
vulgar. Miss Martineau expressed much the same judgment
on'Villette.'And there can be no doubt that there was in
Miss BrontS a curious vein of recklessness, roughness, one
might also say — hoydenism — that exists side by side with ao
exquisite delicacy and a true dignity, and is none the less
Irish and Celtic for that It disappears, so far as one can
see, with the publication of'Shirley;'but, up till then, it
has to be reckoned with. It is conspicuous in the whole
episode of'the curates,* both in real life and in the pages of
'Shirley ;'it is visible especially in certain recently published
letters to Miss Nussey, which one could wish had been left
unprinted ; and it makes the one shadow of excuse for the
inexcusable'Quarterly* article. There is one sentence in
*^ JANE EYRE ^M
*'**gj^st chapter of'Shirley/ which may serve both as u
• " ^,_ . *tion of this defect, and as a landmark pointing to
^^ < ^*** radical differences of feeling that separate 1900 from
< ^^ ~ It occurs in the course of an address to the reader,
* (fc^'^B''''"'" expect neither sentiment, poetry, nor passion

These lines that I have thrown into italics were written m
1850, five years after Newman's secession, in the midst no
doubt of a swelling tide of Liberal reaction, destined, how-
ever, as we all know now, to interfere very little with the
spread and power of those deep undercurrents setting from
the Oxford Movement. The hasty arrogance, the failure in
feeling and right instinct, which the passage shows, mark the
chief limitation and weakness in the artist who wrote it It
is a weakness of taste, a limitation, as Mr, Leslie Stephen
would perhaps insist, of thought and idea. Taken together
with the country-house scenes in'Jane Eyre,'with some of
the curate scenes in'Shirley,'with various passages of raw
didactic and rather shrill preaching, this utterance, and some
others like it, suggest a lack of social intelligence, of a wide
outlook, of that sense, above all, for measure and urbanity
which belongs to other and more perfect art — like George
Sand's — or to a more exquisitely tempered instinct — like that
of Burns. One returns to Renan's explanation :'* We Celts
shall never build a Parthenon ; marble is not for us.'Out
art is uncertain and wavering; liable to many lapses and
false notes. But I —'we lay our grip on heart and soul, we
bring up from the depths of the human spirit the secrets of
the infinite.'

INTRODUCTION xxiu
III
The Irish and Celtic element in Charlotte Bronte, how-
ever, is not all. Far from it Crossing, controlling the
wild impetuous temper of the Irishwoman is an influence
from another world, an influence of habit and long associa-
tion, breathed from Yorkshire, and the hard, frugal, persist-
ent North. One has but to climb her Haworth hills to feel
it flowing around one. Let it be in the winter, on some
frosty white-rimed day, when the tops of the moors are lost
in the cold mist, while a dim sun steals along their sides
showing the great mills in the hollows, the ice -fringed
streams, the bare half-poisoned woods, the rows of stone
cottages, while the horse's hoofs ring sharp on the paidng-
stones of this Haworth Street that mounts stem and steeps
without a relenting slope or zig-zag, heedless of the strained
muscles of man or beast, from the busy factories below to
the towered church and the little parsonage on the hill-top.
The small stone houses mount with you on either hand, low,
ugly, solid, without a trace of colour or ornament, the decent
yet unlovely homes of a sturdy industrious race. The chim-
neys pour out their smoke, the valley hums with life and toiL
You stand at the top of the hill and look around you. Man-
chester and the teeming Lancashire world are behind yo«u
Bradford and Leeds in front of you. You can see nothing
through the sun-lit fog, save the rolling forms of the moors
bearing their dim ever-growing burden of houses ; but you
know that you stand in the heart of working England, the
England that goes through its labour and its play, its trade-
unionism and its football, its weaving or its coal-mining, witfi
equal vigour and tenacity, with all the English love of gain
and the English thirst for success — watchful, jealous, thrifty,
absorbed in this very tangible earth, and the struggle to sub-
due it, stained with many coarse and brutal things, scornful
of the dreamer and the talker, and yet, by virtue of its very
strength of striving life, its very excesses of rough force and

Charlotte, could tear you a passion to tatters, in'Glenarvon,'
with a certain wild power. Take a passage at random : —
'Many can deceive,'said Glenarvon, mournfully gazing on
Calantha whilst she wept ;'but is your lover like the common
herd ? Oh ! we have loved, my gentle mistress, better than
they know how ; we have dared the utmost : your mind and
mine must not even be compared with theirs. Let the vulgar
dissemble and fear— let them talk idly in the unmeaning jargon
they admire; they never felt what we have felt; they never
dared what we have done : to win, and to betray, is with them
an air — a fancy ; and fit is the delight for the beings who can
enjoy it. — But if once I show myself again, the rabble must
shrink at last; they dare not sund before Glenarvon. Heaven
or hell, I care not which, have cast a ray so bright around my
brow that not all the perfidy of a heart as lost as mine, of a
heart loaded, as you know too well, with crimes man shudders
even to imagine— not all the envy and malice of those whom my
contempt has stung can lower me to their level. And yoo,
Calantha, do you think you will ever learn to hate me, even
were I to leave and to betray you ? — Poor blighted flower— to
thy last wretched hour thou wouldst pine in unavailing recollec-
tion and regret; as Clytie, though bound and fettered to the
earth, still fixes her uplifted eyes upon her own sun, who passes
over regardless in his course, nor deigns to cast a look below T
This was passion, masterful passion, as a woman, Bjrron's
pupil, conceived it, in 1816, the year of Charlotte BrontS's
birth. It is instructive sometimes to look back at landmarks
of this lesser kind. There is vigour in these sentences, but
compare their vague and mouthing falsity with any conver-
sation in'Jane Eyre'— ^above all, with the touches in the
last scene between Jane and Rochester. Dwell on the mo-
ment when Jane, carrying the tray, enters the blind man's
presence ; notice how clear and true — with the clearness and
truth of poetry — are all the stages of recognition and of
rapture — till Rochester says : *
'Hitherto I have hated to be helped— to be led ; hencefortli,
I feel I shall hate it no more, I did not like to put my hand
into a hireling's; but it is pleasant to feel it circled by Jane*s

little Rngers. t preferred utter loneliness to the constant at
tendance of servants; but Jane's soft ministry will be a per-
petual joy. Jane suits me ; do I suit her?'
'To the finest fibre of my nature, sir.'. . , Reverently lifting
his hat from his brow, and bending his sightless eyes to the
catth. he stood in mute devotion. Only the last words of the
worship were audible.
'I (hank my Maker that in the midst of judgment He baa
remembered mercy. I humbly entreat ray Redeemer to give
IDC strength to lead henceforth a purer life than I have done
bitheito.'
Then he stretched out his hand to be led. I look that deai
hand, held it a moment to my lips, then let it pass round mj
shoulder ; being so much lower of stature than he, I served both
for his prop and guide. Wc entered the wood and wended
bomeward.
What feeling, and what truth 1 — a truth all Charlotte's
own, not Jane Austen's nor another's — in which we may, il
we will, detect the fusion of two races, the mingUng of twc
worlds.

As to the outer and material history of'Jane Eyre,'it if
written to some extent in Mrs. Gaskell's'Life,'and has en >
ployed the pens of many a critic and local antiquary since
We all know that Lowood is Cowan Bridge, that Helei

that Thomfield Hal) was suggested by one'old Yorkshir <
house, and Fcrndean Manor by another; that St Jobi
Rivers bad an original : we may take for granted that Cbai
lotte's own experiences as a governess have passed into ihi
bitterness with which the rich and'society'ate described
and Mrs. Gaskcll has recorded that, according to Charlotte'
own testimony, the incident of the midnight voice heard b
Rochester and Jane was'true'and'really happened.'

Such identifications and researches will always have their
interest, though the artist never sees as the critic sees, and is
often filled with a secret amazement when he or she is led
back to the scene or the person which b supposed to have
furnished — which did indeed furnish — the germ, and the
clay. The student will collect these details ; the reader will
do well not to pay too much attention to them. The literary
afHliations and connections of the book would be far more
important and significant if one could trace them. But they
are not easy to trace.
If one gathers together the information to be gleaned from
Mrs. Gaskell's * Life * and elsewhere, as to Charlotte's book
education — that voracious and continuous reading to which we
have many references, one may arrive at a general outline,
something of this kind. — ^There were no children's books
in Haworth Parsonage. The children there were nourisli-
ed upon the food of their elders: the Bible, Shakspeare,
Addison, Johnson, Sheridan, Cowper, for the past; Scott,
Byron, Southey, Wordsworth, Coleridge, * Blackwood's Mag-
azine,''Eraser's Magazine,'and Leigh Hunt for the modems;
on a constant supply of newspapers. Whig and Tory — Chai^
lotte once said to a friend that she had taken an interest in
politics since she was five years old— on current biographies
such as Lockhart's Life of Bums, Moore's Lives of Bjrroii
and Sheridan, Southey's'Nelson,'Wolfe's * Remains ;'and
on miscellaneous readings of old Methodist magazines con-
taining visions and miraculous conversions, Mrs. Rowe*i
* Letters from the Dead to the Living,'the * British Essa]^
ists,'collected from the * Rambler,'the'Mirror,'and else-
where, and stories from the * Lady's Magazine.'They
breathed, therefore, as far as books were concemed a brac-
ing and stimulating air from the beginning. Nothing was
softened or adapted for them. Before little Maria, the eldest
girl, died, at the age of eleven, her father could discuss with
her any current topic in which he himself was interested, at
though she were grown-up and his equal.
The Duke of Wellington was their nursery-hero, and Char*
lotte, a child of twelve, recorded at the time the emotions

INTRODUCTION
But she did read George Sand, as the same letter informs
us, and the influence of that great romantic artist in whom
restless imagination went hand in hand with a fine and
chosen realism, was probably of some true importance in
the development of Charlotte Bronte's genius. During her
two years in Brussels, under the teaching of M. H^ger —
who gave her passages from Victor Hugo to study as models
of style, and was himself a keen reader, critic, and lecturer —
there can be little question that she made wide acquaiqtance
with the French books of the day, and it was the day of
Victor Hugo, Alfred de Musset and George Sand. It has
not yet, I think, been pointed out that there is in'Jacques'
— a novel written in 1834 — a very curious anticipation of the
cry of Rochester to Jane. The passage occurs in a letter
from Sylvia, the sbterly friend, to Jacques, about to become
the husband of Femande : —
Mon & me est habitu6e i vivre seule, Dieu le vent ainsi ; que
vient faire la tienne dans ma solitude ? Viens-tu m'avertir de
quelque danger, ou m'annoncer quelque malheur plus 6pouvaiH
table que tous ceux auxquels a suffi mon courage ? L'autre soir
j*6tais assise au pied de la montagne ; le ciel 6tatt voil^ et le
vent gemissait dans les arbres ; j'ai entendu distinctement, aa
milieu de ces sons d'une triste harmonic, le son de ta vols.
Elle a jet6 trois ou quatre notes dans I'espace, faibles, maisll
pures et si saisissables que j'ai 6t6 voir les buissons d'oii elle
euit partie pour m'assurer que tu n'y 6tais pas. Ces choses-li
m*ont rarement tromp6e ; Jacques, il faut qu'il y ait un orage
sur nos tites.
The suggestion, the romantic suggestion of these sentences
may very possibly have come in Charlotte Bront£*s way, may
X have mingled with, perhaps given birth to, some later fancy
I or experience, of which she spoke to Mrs. Gaskell, and so
I found shape ultimately in the thrilling scene of * Jane Eyre.'
I Of direct imitation of George Sand there is nowhere any
I trace ; but in certain parts of * Shirley,* in the * Marriage of
^ j Genius and Humanity,'for instance, the stimulating influence
( I of certain famous passages in'L^ia* suggests itself readily;

AUTHOR'S PREFACE
A PREFACE to the first edition of'Jane Eyre'being un-
necessary, I gave none : this second edition demands a few
words both of acknowledgment and miscellaneous remark.
My thanks are due in three quarters.
To the Public, for the indulgent ear it has inclined to a
plain tale with few pretensions.
To the Press, for the fair field its honest suffrage has
opened to an obscure'aspirant
To my Publishers, for the aid their tact, their energy,
their practical sense, and frank liberality have afforded an
unknown and unrecommended Author.
The Press and the Public are but vague personifications
for me, and I must thank them in vague terms; but mj
Publishers are definite : so are certain generous critics wl)ns
have encouraged me as only large-hearted and high-minded
men know how to encourage a struggling stranger ; to them,
/. c, to my Publishers and the select Reviewers, I say cord*
ially, Gentlemen, I thank you from my heart.
Having thus acknowledged what I owe those who have
aided and approved me, I turn to another class; a small
one, so far as I know, but not, therefore, to be overlooked.
I mean the timorous or carping few who doubt the tendenqf
of such books as'Jane Eyre': in whose eyes whatever is
unusual is wrong ; whose ears detect in each protest'against
bigotry — that parent of crime — an insult to piety, that
regent of God on earth. I would suggest to such doubters

PREFACE
of'Vanity Fair'admired in high places? I cannot tell;
but I think if some of those amongst whom he hurb the
Greek fire of his sarcasm, and over whom he flashes the
levin-brand of his denunciation, were to take his warnings
in time — they or their seed might yet escape a fatal Ramoth*
Gilead.
Why have I alluded to this man ? I have alluded to
him, Reader, because I think I see in him an intellect pro-
founder and more unique than his contemporaries have yet
recognised ; because I regard him as the first social regener-
ator of the day — as the very master of that working corps
who would restore to rectitude the warped system of things;
because I think no commentator on his writings has yet
found the comparison that suits him, the terms which rightly
characterise his talent They say he is like Fielding ; they
talk of his wit, humour, comic powers. He resembles
Fielding as an eagle does a vulture : Fielding could stoop
on carrion, but Thackeray never does. His wit is bright,
his humour attractive, but both bear the same relation to
his serious genius, that the mere lambent sheet -lightning;
playing under the edge of the summer cloud, does to the
electric death-spark hid in its womb. Finally; I have alludeil
to Mr. Thackeray, because to him — if he will accept die
tribute of a total stranger — I have dedicated thb second
edition of'J[anb Eyrb.'

JANE EYRE
CHAPTEB I
There was no possibility of taking a walk that day. We
had been wandering, indeed, in the leafless shrubbery an
hour in the morning ; but since dinner (Mrs. Beed, when
there was no company, dined early) the cold winter wind
had brought with it clouds so sombre, and a rain so pene-
trating, that further outdoor exercise was now out of the
question.
I was glad of it : I never liked long walks, especially on
chilly afternoons : dreadful to me was the coming home in
the raw twilight, with nipped fingers and toes, and a heart
saddened by the chidings of Bessie, the nurse, and humbled
by the consciousness of my physical inferiority to EUsav
John, and Georgiana Beedi
The said Eliza, John, and Georgiana were now clustered
round their mamma in the drawing-room : she lay reclined
on the sofa by the fireside, and with her darlings about her
(for the time neither quarrelling nor crying^ looked perfectly
happy. Me, she had dispensed from joining the group;
! saying,'She regretted to be under the necessity of " keeping
me at a distance ; but that until she heard from Bessie and
could discover by her own observation that I was endeavour-
ing in good earnest to acquire a more sociable and childlike
disposition, a more attractive and sprightly manner — some-
thing lighter, franker, more natui*al« as it were — she really
must exclude me from privileges intended only for contented^
happy, little children.'

and snow, where finn fields of ice, the accumulation of
conturies of winters, glazed in Alpine heights above heights*
surround the pole, and concentre the multiplied rigors of
extreme cold.'Of these death-white realms I formed an
idea of my own : shadowy, like all the half -comprehended
notions that float dim through children's brains, but strangely
impressive. The words in these introductory pages con*
nected themselves with the succeeding vignettes, and gave
significance to the rock standing up alone in a sea of billow
and spray ; to the broken boat stranded on a desolate coast ;
to the < $old and ghastly moon glancing through bars of cloud
at a wreck just sinking.
I I cannot tell what sentiment haunted th & quite. solitary
j churchyard, ^rith its inscribed headstone; its gate, ite
two trees, its low horizon, girdled by a broken waU,
and its newly-risen crescent, attesting the hour of even-
I tide.
j The two ships becalmed on a torpid sea I believed to be
I marine phantoms.
; The fiend pinning down the thief s pack, behind him
> I passed over quickly : it was an object of terror.
j So was the black, homed thing seated aloof on a rock,
surveying a distant crowd surrounding a gallows.
1 Each picture told a story; mysterious often to my
undeveloped understanding and imperfect feelings, yet ever
J profoundly interesting: as interesting as the tales Bessie
sometimes narrated on winter evenings, when she chanced
^ to be in good humour ; and when, having brought her ironing-
table to the nursery-hearth, she aUowed us to sit about ii,
and while she got up Mrs. Beed's lace frills, and crimped
her night-cap borders, fed our eager attention with passages
of love and adventure taken from old fairy tales and older
ballads ; or (as at a later period I discovered) from the pagee
of'Pamela/ and'Henry, Earl of Moreland.'
With Bewick on my knee, I was then happy : happy aft
least in my way. I feared nothing but interruption, and
that came too soon. The breakfast-room door opened.

of being dragged forth by the said Jack. .

John Seed nas a schoolboy of fourteen years old ; four
years oldtr than I, for I was but tea ; large and stont for
his age, with a dingy and unwholesome skin ; thick
lineamenu in a spacious visage, heavy limbs and lai^ ex-
tremities. He gorged himself habitually at table, which
made him bilious, and gave him a dim and bleared eye and
flabby cheeks. He ought now to have been at scho^ ; but
his in»nim:i had taken him home for a month or two,'on

heart torxed from an opinion so harsh, and inclined rather
to the mcse reSned idea that John's saUowness was owing
to over-application and, perhaps, to pining after home.

morsel of flesh on my bones shrank when he came near.
There were moments when I was bewildered by the temv
he inspired, because I had no appeal whatever against
either his menaces or his inflictions ; the servants did not
like to offend their young master by taking my part against
him, and Mrs. Beed was blind and deaf on the subject : she
never saw him strike or heard him abuse me, thougih ha
did both now and then in her very presence; mors
frequently, however, behind her back.
Habitually obedient to John, I came up to his chair : ha
spent some three minutes in thrusting out his tongue at ma
as far as he could without damaging the roots : I knew ha
would soon strike, and while dreading the blow, I mosad
on the disgusting and ugly appearance of him who wonld
presently deal it. I wonder if he read that notion in my
face ; for, all at once, without speaking, he struck suddenly
and strongly. I tottered, and on regaining my equilibrium
retired back a step or two from his chair.
'That is for your impudence in answering mamma
awhile since,'said he,'and for your sneaking way of getting
behind ciui;ains, and for the look you had in your eyes two
minutes since, you rat I'
Accustomed to John Seed's abuse, I never had an~idea
of replying to it ; my care was how to endure the Uow
which would certainly follow the insult.
'What were you doing behind the curtain?'he
asked.
'I was reading.'
• Show the book.'
I returned to the window and fetched it thenoe.
'You have no business to take our books ; you are %
dependent, mamma says ; you have no money ; your father
left you none ; you ought to beg, and not to Uve here with
gentlemen's children like us, and eat the same meals we
do, and wear clothes at our mamma's expense. Now^ I'll

I did so, not at first aware what was his intention ; bat
when I saw him hft and poise tha book and stand in aot to ,
hurl it, I instinctively started aside with a cry of alarm : not
soon enough, however ; the volume was flung, it hit rae, and
I fell, striking my bead against the door and cutting it. The
cut bled, the pain was sharp : my terror hod passed its
climas ; other feelings succeeded.

IMd you hear her, Eliza and Georgiana ? Won't I tell mamma ?

He ran headlong at me : I felt him grasp my hair and
my shoulder : ho had closed with a desperate thing. I
really saw in him a tyrant : a murderer. I felt a drop or
two of blood from my head trickle down my neck, and was
sensible of somewhat pungent suffering: these sensations
for the time predominated over fear, and I received him in
frantic sort. I don't very well know what I did with my
hands, but he called me'Bat I rat 1'and liellowed out
aloud. Aid was near him : Eliza and Georgiana had run
for tin. Reed, who was gone upstairs ; she now came upon
the scene, followed by Bessie and her maid Abbot. We
were parted : I heard the words : —'Dear I dear t What a
fury to fiy at Master John t'
'Did ever anybody see such a picture of passion I'
Then Mrs. Beed subjoined : —'Take her away to the red-
room, and lock her in there.'Four hands were immediately
laid upon me, and I was borne upstairs.

I BE8I8TED all the way : a new thing for me, and a droom-
stance which greatly strengthened the bad opinion Bessie
and Miss Abbot were disposed to entertain of me. The fact
is, I was a trifle beside myself ; or rather out of myself, as
the French would say : I was conscious that a moment's
mutiny had already rendered me liable to strange penalties,
and, like any other rebel slave, I felt resolved, in my despera-
tion, to go aJl lengths.
J'Hold her arms, Miss Abbot : she's like a mad oai.*
I'For shame I for shame I'cried the lady's-maid. * What
, shocking conduct, Miss Eyre, to strike a young gentleman,
your benefactress's son I Your yoimg master.'
'Master I How is he my master ? Am I a servant?'
'No ; you are less than a servant, for you do nothing for
your keep. There, sit down, and think over your ¥dok6d*
ness.'
i They had got me by this time into the apartment
indicated by Mrs. Beed, and had thrust me upon a stool :
my impulse was to rise from it like a spring; their two
pairs of hands arrested me instantly.
'If you don't sit still, you must be tied down,* said
Bessie.'Miss Abbot, lend me your garters; she would
break mine directly.'
Miss Abbot turned to divest a stout leg of the necessary
ligature. This preparation for bonds, and the additional
ignominy it inferred, took a little of the excitement out of me.
'Don't take them off,'I cried ;'I will not stir.'
In guarantee whereof I attached myself to my seal by
my hands.

'Mind yon don't,'said Bessie ; and when she had ascer-
tained that I was really subsiding, she loosened her hold
of me; then she and Miss Abbot stood with folded arms,
looking darkly and doubtfully on my face, as incredulous
of my sanity.
'She never did 80 before,'at last eaJd Bessie, turning to
the AbigaiL
'But it was always in her,'was the reply.'I've told
Missis often my opinion about the child, and Missis agreed
with me. She's an underhand little thing: I never saw a
girl of her age with so much cover.'
Bessie answered not; but ere long, addressing me, she
sud:
'Ton ought to be aware, Miss, that yon axe under obliga-
tions to Mrs. Keed : she keeps you : if she were to turn you
off, yon would have to go to the poor-house.'
I had nothing to say to these words : they were not new
to me : my very first reoollections of existence included
hinte of the same kind. This reproach of my dependenoe
hiid become a vague sing-song in my ear ; very painful and
crushing, but only half intelligible. Miss Abbot joined in : —
'And you ought not to think yourself on an equality with
the Misses Beed and Master Beed, because Missis kindly
allows you to be brought up with them. They will have a
great deal of money, and you will have none : it is your
place to be humble, and to try to make yourself agreeable
to them.'
'What we tell you is for your good,'added Bessie, in no
harsh voico :'you should try to- be useful and pleasant,
tben, perhaps, yon would have a home here ; but if yon
become passionate and rudci Missis will send you away, I
am sure.'
'Besides,'said Miss Abbot,'God will punish her : He
might strike her dead in the midst of her tantrums, and
then where would she go?'Come, Bessie, we will leave
her ; I wouldn't have her heart for anything. Say your
prayers, Miss Eyre, when you are by yourself ; for if you

don't repent, something bad might be permitted to oome

They went, shutting the door, and locking it behind
them.
The red-room was a spare chamber,, very seldom slept
in ; I might say never, indeed, unless when a chance influx
of visitors at Gateshead Hall rendered it necessary to turn
to account all the accommodation it contained: yet it was
one of the largest and stateliest chambers in the mansion.
A bed supported on massive pillars of mahogany, hung with
curtains of deep red damask, stood out like a tabemade in
the centre ; the two large windows, with their blinds always
drawn down, were half shrouded in festoons and falls of
similar drapery ; the carpet was red : the table at the fool
of the bed was covered with a crimson doth; the walls
were a soft fawn colour, with a blush of pink in it ; the
wardrobe, the toilet-table, the chairs were of darkly-polished
old mahogany. Out of these deep surrounding shades rose
high, and glared white, the piled-up mattresses and pillows
of the bed, spread with a snowy Marseilles oounterpane.
Scarcely less prominent was an ample, cushioned easy-chair
near the head of the bed, also white, with a footstool bciore
it ; and looking, as I thought, like a pale throne.
This room was chill, because it seldom had afire ; it
silent, because remote from the nursery and
solemn, because it was known to be so seldom entered.
The housemaid alone came here on Saturdays, to wipe from
the mirrors and the furniture a week's quiet dust : ud Mrs.
Beed herself, at far intervals, visited it to review the oontents
of a certain secret drawer in the wardrobe, where were stored
divers parchments, her jewel-casket, and a miniature of her
deceased husband ; and in those last words lies the seorel
of the red-room — the spell which kept it so lonely in spite of
its grandeur.
Mr. Reed had been dead nine years: it was in this
chamber he breathed his last ; here he lay in state ; henoe
his ooffin was borne by the undertaker's men ; and, sinoe

^t day, a seDse of dreary consecration had guarded it from
/'*^U6nt intrusion.
Uy seat, to which Bessie and the bitter Mies Abbot had
Itftme riveted, waa a low ottoman near the marble chimney*
flece ; the bed rose beFore me ; to my right hand there was
tbe high, dark wardrobe, with subdued, broken reflections
niyjng the gloss of its paneb ; to my leCt were the muffled
ttindows ; a great looking-glass between them repeated the
meant majesty of the bed and room. I was not quite sure
whether they had locked the door ; and, when I dared mors,
I got up. and went to see. Alas 1 yes : no jail was erar
more secure. Beluming, I had to cross before the looking'
glass ; my fascinated glance involuntarily explored the depUi
it revealed. All looked colder and darker in that visionary
hollow than in reality : and the strange httle figure there
gasing at me, with a white face and arms specking the
gloom, and glittering eyes of fear moving where all else wh
■till, had the effect of a real spirit : I thought it like one of
the liny phantoms, halt fairy, half imp, Bessie's evening
stories represented as coming out of lone, ferny dells in
moors, and appearing before the eyes of belated travellers.
I returned to my stooL
Superstition was with me at that moment ; but it was
not yet her hour for complete victory : my blood was still
warm ; the mood of the revolted slave was still bracing me
with its bitter vigour ; I had to stem a rapid rush of retro-
spective thought before I quailed to the dismal present.
All John Beed's violent tyrannies, all his sisters'proud
indifference, all his mother's aversion, all the servants'par-
tiality, tamed up in my disturbed mind like a dark deposit

acrid spite, a captious and insolent carriage, was universally
indulged. Her beauty, her pink oheeks and golden curls,

i seemed to give delight to all who looked at her, and to
I purchase indemnity for every fault. John, no one thwarted,
I much less punished ; though he twisted the necks of the
pigeons, killed the little pea-ohioks, set the dogs at the
• sheep, stripped the hothouse vines of their fruit, and broke
the buds off the choicest plants in the conservatory: he
called his mother'old girl,* too ; sometimes reviled her ior
her dark skin, similar to his own ; bluntly disregarded her
wishes ; not imfrequently tore and spoiled her silk attire ;
and he was still'her own darling.'I dared commit no
j fault; I strove to fulfil every duty; and I was termed
naughty and tiresome, sullen and sneaking, from morning
to noon, and from noon to night.
My head still ached and bled with the Uow and fall
I had received : no one had reproved John for wantonly
striking me ; and because I had turned against him to
avert farther irrational nolence, I was loaded with general
opprobrium.
'Unjust 1 — unjust I'said my reason, forced by the
agonising stimulus into precocious thon^ transitory
j power; and Resolve, equally wrought up, instigated some
strange expedient to achieve escape from insupportaUe
oppression — as running away, or, if that could not be
effected, never eating or drinking more, and letting myself
die.

afternoon I How all my brain was in timiult, and all my

j ignorance, was the mental battle fought 1 I oould noft
i answer the ceaseless inward question — why I thus suflfeied;
I now, at the distance of — I will not say how many years, I
see it dearly.
I was a discord in Gateshead Hall ; I was like nobody
there; I had nothing in harmony with Mrs. Seed or her
children, or her chosen vassalage. If they did not love me,
in fact, as little did I love them. They were not bound to
regard with affection a thing that could not sympathise with

one amongst them ; a heterogeoeous thing, opposed to them
in lemperament, in capacity, in propensities ; a uRetess thing,
incapable of serving their interest, or adding to their
pleasure ; a noxious thing, cherishing the germs of iudigna-
tion at their treatment, of contempt of their judgment. I
know that had I been a sanguine, brilliant, careless, exacting.
handsome, romping child— though equally dependent and
friendless — ^Mrs. Beed would have endured my presenoa
more complacently ; her children would have entertained
for me more of the cordiality of fellow-feeling ; the sei-vants
would have been less prone to make me the scapegoat of
the nursery.
Daylight began to forsake the red-room ; it was past four
o'clock, and the beclouded afternoon was tending to drear
twilight. I heard the rain still beating continuously on the
staircase window, and the wind howling in the grove behind
the ball ; I grew by degrees cold as a stone, and then my
ooorage Bank. My habitnal mood of homiliatioo, self-doubt,
forlorn depression, foil damp on the embers of my decaying
ire. All said I was wicked, and perhaps I might be so :
what thought had I been but just conceiving of starving
myself to death ? That certainly was a crime : and was I
fit to die 7 Or was the vault under the chancel of Gateshead
CbuToh an inviting bourne 7 In such vault I had been told
did Mr. Bced lie buried ; and led by this thought to recall
his idea, I dwelt on it with gathering dread. I could not re-
member him ; but I knew that he was my own uncle — my
mother's brother — that he had taken me when a parentless
infant to his bouse ; and that in'his last moments he had
required a promise of Mrs. Beed that she would rear and
muntain me as one of her own children. Mrs. Beed probably
considered she had kept thia promise ; and so she had, I
dare say, as well as her nature would permit her ; but how
could she really like an interloper not of her race, and un >
connected with her, after her husband's death, by any tie?
It must have been most irksome to find herself bound by a
hard-wrong pledge to stand in the stead of a parent to a

strange child she could not love, and to see an uncongenial
alien permanently intruded on her own family group.
A singular notion dawned upon me. I doubted not —
never doubted — that if Mr. Beed had been alive he would
have treated me kindly ; and now» as I sat looking at the
white bed and overshadowed walls — occasionally also turning
a fascinated eye towards the dimly gleaming mirror — I began
to recall what I had heard of dead men, troubled in their
graves by the violation of their last wishes, revisiting the
earth to punish the perjured and avenge the oppressed ; and
I thought Mr. Beed*s spirit, harassed by the wrongs of his
sister's child, might quit its abode — ^whether in the ohuroh
vault, or in the unknown world of the departed — and rise
before me in this chamber. I wiped my tears and hushed
my sobs, fearful lest any sign of violent grief might waken %
pretematiural voice to comfort me, or elicit from the gloom
some haloed face, bending over me with strange pity. This
idea, consolatory in theory, I felt would be terrible if realised :
with all my might I endeavoured to stifle it — I endeavoured
to be firm. Shaking my hair from my eyes, I lifted my head
and tried to look boldly roimd the dark room. At this
moment a Ught gleamed on the walL Was it, I asked my*
self, a ray from the moon penetrating some aperture in the
blind ? No ; moonUght was still, and this stirred ; while I
gazed, it gUded up to the ceiling and quivered over my head.
I can now conjecture readily that this streak of light was, in
all likelihood, a gleam from a lantern, carried by some one
across the lawn: but then, prepared as my mind was for
horror, shaken as my nerves were by agitation, I thought
the swift-darting beam was a herald of some coming vision
from another world. My heart beat thick, my head grew
hot ; a sound filled my ears, which I deemed ttie rushing of
wings : something seemed near me ; I was oppressed, suffo-
cated : endurance broke down ; I rushed to the door and nhock
the lock in desperate effort. Steps came running along the
outer passage ; the key turned, Bessie and Abbot entered.
* Miss Eyre, are you ill 7'said Bessie.

The next thing I remember is, waking up with a feeling as
if I had had a frightful nightmare, and seeing before me m
terrible red glare, crossed with thick black bars. I heard
voices, too, speaking with a hollow sound, as if muffled by m
rush of wind or water : agitation, uncertainty, and an all*
predominating sense of terror confused my faculties. Ere
long I became aware that some one was handling me ; lifting
me up and supporting me in a sitting posture, and that mors
tenderly than I had ever been raised or upheld befcne. I
rested my head against a pillow or an arm, and felt easy.
In five minutes more the doud of bewilderment dis-
solved : I knew quite well that I was in my own bed, and
that the red glare was the nursery fire. It was night : s
candle burnt on the table ; Bessie stood at the bed-foci witii
a basin in her hand, and a gentleman sat in a chair near my
pillow, leaning over me.
I felt an inexpressible relief, a soothing conviction oC
protection and security, when I knew that there was s
stranger in the room, an individual not belonging to Gates*
head, and not related to Mrs. Beed. Turning from Bessis
(though her presence was far less obnoxious to me than thai
of Abbot, for instance, would have been), I scrutinised the
face of the gentleman : I knew him ; it was Mr. Lloyd, an
apothecary, sometimes called in by Mrs. Beed when the asr*
vants were ailing : for herself and the children she employed
a physician.
'WeU, who am I?'he asked.
I pronounced his name, oflfering him at the same time
my hand : he took it, smiling and saying,'We shall do very

At last both slept : the fire and the candle went oat.
For me, the watches of that long night passed in ghastly
wakefulness; ear, eye, and mind were alike strained by
dread : such dread as children only can feeL
No severe or prolonged bodily illness followed thia
incident of the red-room : it only gave my nerves a shock,
of which I feel the reverberation to this day. Yes, Mrs.
Heed, to you I owe some fearful pangs of mental suffering.
But I ought to forgive you, for you knew not what you did :
while rending my heart-strings, you thought you were only
uprooting my bad propensities.
Next day, by noon, I was up and dressed, and sat wrapped
in a shawl by the nursery hearth. I felt physicaUy weak
and broken down ; but my worse ailment was an unutterable
wretchedness of mind : a wretchedness which kept drawing
from me silent tears ; no sooner had I wiped one salt drop
from my cheek than another followed. Yet I thought I
ought to have been happy, for none of the Reeds were there,
they were all gone out in the carriage with their mamma :
Abbot, too, was sewing in another room, and Bessie, as she
moved hither and thither, putting away toys and arranging^
drawers, addressed to me every now and then a word of on*
wonted kindness. This state of things should have been to
me a paradise of peace, accustomed as I was to a life of
ceaseless reprimand and thankless fagging ; but, in fact, my
racked nerves were now in such a state that no calm coold
soothe, and no pleasure excite them agreeably.
Bessie had been down into the kitchen, and she brought
up with her a tart on a certain brightly painted china plate,
whose bird of paradise, nestling in a wreath of oonvolvoli
and rosebuds, had been wont to stir in me a most enthu-
siastic sense of admiration ; and which plate I had often
petitioned to be allowed to take in my hand in order to
1^ j examine it more closely, but had always hitherto been

. I had ofteD heard the song before, and always wiih lively
delight ; for Bessie had a sweet voice— at least I thought so.
But now, though her voice was still sweet, I found in its
melody an indescribable sadness. Sometimes, preoccupied
with her work, she sang the refrain very low, very lingerly ;
* A long time ago'came out like the saddest cadence .of a
funeral hymn. She passed into another ballad, this time a
really doleful one.
My feet they are sore, and my limbs they are weaiy ;
Long is Ihe way, and the mountains are wild ;
Soon will tlie twilight close moonless and dreary
Over the path of the poor orphan child.
Why did they send me so far and so lonely.
Up where the moors spread and grey rocks are piled!
Men are hard-hearted, and kind angels only
Watch o*er the steps of a poor orphan child.
Tet distant and soft the night-breeze is blowing.
Clouds there are none, and dear stars beam mild ;
God, in His mercy, protection is showing.
Comfort and hope to the poor orphan child.
Ev'n should I fall o*er the broken bridge passing.
Or stray in the marshes, by false lights begoiled.
Still will my Father, with promise and blessing.
Take to His bosom the poor orphan child.
There is a thought that for strength should avail me»
Though both of shelter and kindred despoiled;
Heaven is a home, and a rest will not fail me ;
God is a friend to the poor orphan child.
'Gome, Miss Jane, don't cry,'said Bessie, as she finished.
She might as well have said to the fire,'don't bum I'but
how co\ild she divine the morbid suffering to which I was a
prey ? In the course of the morning Mr. Uoyd came again.
'What, already up I'said he, as he entered the nursery.
'Well, nurse, how is she ?'
Bessie answered that I was doing very welL
'Then she ought to look more cheerful. Come here^

'Ghost I What, you are a baby after all 1 Yon are afraid
of ghosts?'
'Of Mr. Heed's ghost I am : he died in that room, and
was laid out there. Neither Bessie nor any one else will go
into it at night, if they can help it ; and it was cmel to shut
me up alone without a candle, — so cruel that I think I shall
never forget it.'
'Nonsense! And is it that makes you so miserable?
Are you afraid now in daylight?'
'No : but night will come again before long : and besides,
—I am unhappy, — very unhappy, for other things.*
'What other things ? Can you tell me some of them 7 *
How much I wished to reply fully to this question I
How difficult it was to frame any answer I Children oan
feel, but they cannot analyse their feelings; and if the
analysis is partially effected in thought, they know not how
to express the resiilt of the process in words. Eearfol.
however, of losing this first and only opportunity of relieving
my grief by imparting it, I, after a disturbed pause* con-
trived to frame a meagre, though, as far as it went^ troe
response. —
'For one thing, I have no father or mother, brothers or
sisters.'
'You have a kind aunt and cousins.'
Again I paused ; then bunglingly enounced : * Bui John
Reed knocked me down, and my aunt shut me np in the
red-room.'
Mr. Lloyd a second time produced his snuff-box.
'Don't you think Gateshead • Hall a very beantifal
house?'asked he.'Are you not very thankful to have
such a fine place to live at?'
'It is not *my house, sir ; and Abbot says I have leas
right to be here than a servant'
'Pooh 1 you can't be silly enough to wish to leave sooh
, a splendid place ?'
I*'If I had anywhere else to go, I should be glad to leave it;
but I can never get away from Gateshead till I am a woman.'

'Perhaps you may — who knows? Have you aoy rela-
tioos besides Mrs. Beed?'
'I tbiok Dot, sir.'
'Moae beloDgiag to your father 7'
'I don't know : I asked aunt Reed once, and she said
posUbly I might have some poor, low relations called Eyre,
but she knew nothing about them.'
• If you had such, would you like to go to them ?'
I reflected. Poverty looks grim to grown people ; still
more so to children : they have not much idea of industrious,
working, respectable poverty ; they think of the word only
as connected with ragged clothes, scanty food, fireless grates,
rude manners, and debasing vices: poverty tor me was
Byuonymoua with degradation.
'No ; I should not like to belong to poor people,'was
my reply.
'Not even if they were kind to you ?'
I shook my head : I could not see how poor people had
the means of being kind; and then to leam to speak like
them, to adopt their manners, to be uneducated, to grow up
like one of the poor women I saw sometimes nursing their
children or washing their clothes at the cottage doors of the
village of Gateshead : no, I was not heroic enough to pur-
chase liberty at the price of caste.
'But are your relatives so very poor ? Are they working
people?'
'I cannot tell ; aunt Beed^ys, if I have any, they must
be a beggarly set i I should not like to go a begging.'
'Would yon like to go to school 7'
Again I reflected : I scarcely knew what school was ;
Bessie sometimes spoke of it as a place where young ladies
sat in the stocks, wore backboards, and were expected to be
exceedingly genteel and precise : John Beed hated bis
■chool, and abused his master ; but John Heed's tastes
were no rule for mine, and il Bessie's accounts of school
discipline (gathered from the young ladies of a family wbere
the had lived before coming to Gateshead) were somewhat

JANE ETBB SS
appalling, her details of certain accomplishments attained by
these same young ladies were, I thought, equally attractive.
She boasted of beautiful paintings of landscapes and flowers
by them executed ; of songs they could sing and pieces they
could play, of purses they could net, of French books they
could translate ; till my spirit was moved to emulation as I
listened. Besides, school would be a complete change : it
implied a long journey, an entire separation from Gateshead,
an entrance into a new life.
* I should indeed like to go to school,* was the audiUa
conclusion of my musings.
'Well, well ; who knows what may happen ?'said Mr.
Lloyd, as he got up : * The child ought to hare change of
air and scene,'he added, speaking to himself ;'nerves not
in a good state.'
Bessie now returned ; at the same moment the carriage
was heard rolling up the gravel-walk.
'Is that your mistress, nurse?'asked Mr. Lloyd.'I
should like to speak to her before I go.'
Bessie invited him to walk into the breakfast-room, and
led the way out. In the interview which followed betweeir'
him and Mrs. Beed, I presume, from after-occurrences, thai
the apothecary ventured to recommend my being sent to
school; and the recommendation was no doubt readily
enough adopted ; for as Abbot said, in discussing the subject
with Bessie when both sat sewing in the nursery one night,
after I was in bed, and, as they thought, asleep,'Missis was,
j she dared say, glad enough to get rid of such a tiresome, ill-
conditioned child, who always looked as if she were watch-
ing everybody, and scheming plots underhand.'Abbot, I
think, gave me credit for being a sort of infantine Gay
Fawkes.
On that same occasion I learned, for the first time, from
Miss Abbot's communications to Bessie, that my father had
been a poor clergyman ; that my mother had married him
against the wishes of her friends, who considered the match
beneath her ; that my grandfather Beed was so irritated al

her disobedience, he cut her ofT without a shilling; that after
my mother and father had been married a year, the latter
e & oght the tj'phuB fever vvhile visiting among the poor of a
Iftrge manufacturing to^vn where his curacy was situated,
aod where that disease was then prevalent ; that my mother
took the infcctioD from him, and both died within a month
of each other.
Bessie, when she heard this Darrative, sighed and said,
'Poor Miss Jane is to be pitied, too, AhboL'
'Yes,'responded Abbot,'if she were a nice, pretty child,
one might compassionate her forlomneas ; but one really
cannot care for such a little toad as that.'
'Not a great deal, to be sure,'agreed Besste :'at any rate,
a beauty tike Miss Qeorgiana would be more moving in the
same condidon.'
'Yes, I doat on Miss Georgiaoa I'cried the fervent Abbot.
'Ijttla darling t — with her long curls and her blue eyes, and

'So ooutd I — with a roast onion. Come, we'll go down.'

CHAPTEB IV
From my discourse with Mr. Lloyd, and from the aboye-
reportcd conference between Bessie and Abbot, I gathered
enough of hope to suffice as a motive for wishing to get well:
a change seemed near, — I desired and waited it in silence. It
tarried, however : days and weeks passed : I had regained
my normal state of health, but no new allusion v^as made to
the subject over which I brboded. Mrs. Beed surveyed ma
at times with a severe eye, but seldom addressed me : since
my illness she hod drawn a more marked line of separation
than ever between me and her own children ; appointing me
a small closet to sleep in by myself, condenming me to
take my meals alone, and pass all my time in the nursery,^
while my cousins were constantly in the drawing-room.
Not a hint, however, did she drop about sending me to
school : still I felt an instinctive certainty that she would
not long endure me under the same roof with her ; for her
glance, now more than ever, when turned on me» expressed
an insuperable and rooted aversion.
Eliza and Georgiana, evidently acting according to orders,
spoke to me as little as possible : John thrust his tongue in
his cheek whenever he saw me, and once attempted chastise-
ment ; but as I instantly turned against him, roused by the
same sentiment of deep ire and desperate -revolt which had
stirred my corruption before, he thought it better to deaisti
and ran from me, uttering execrations, and vowing I had
burst his nose. I had indeed levelled at that prominent
feature as hard a blow as my knuckles could inflict ; and
when I saw that either that or my look daunted him, I
had the greatest inclination to foUow up my advantage to

poTposa ; but he wm already with his mamma. T heard him
in & blubbering tone commence the tale of how'that nasty
JlU3e Eyre'had flown at him Uke a mad cat : he was stopped
rather harshly —'Don't talk to me about her, John : I told
you not to go near her ; aha is not worthy of notice ; I do
not choose that either yoa or your sisters should assoaiate
with her.'
Here, leaning over the banister, I cried ont suddenly,
and without at all deliberating on my words, —'They are not
fit to associate with me.'
Mrs. Becd was rather a stout woman ; but on hearing
this strange and audacious declaratioa, she ran nimbly up
the stair, swept me like a whirhrind into the nursery, and
crushing me down on the edge of my crib, dared me in an
emphatic voice to rise from that place, or utter one syllable,
during the remainder of the day.
'What would uncle Beed say to you, if he were alive ? *
waa my scaively voluntary demand. I say scarcely voloa-
tary, tor it seemed as if my tongue pronounced words with-
out my will consenting to their utterance : eomelbing spoke
out of me over which I had no control.
'What 7'said Mrs- Beed under her breath : her usually
cold composed grey eye became troubled with a look like
fear; she took her hand from my arm, and gazed at me
& s if she really did not know whether I were child or fiend-
I was now in for it.
'My uncle Beed is in heaven, and can see all you do and
think ; and so can papa and mamma: they know how you
shut me up all day long, and how you wish me dead.'
Mrs. Reed soon ralli^ her spirits : she shook me most
sonndly, she boxed both my ears, and then left me without
a word. Bessie supplied the hiatus by a homily of an hour's
tengtb, in which she proved beyond a doubt that I was the
most wicked and abandoned child ever reared under a roof.
I half believed her ; for I felt indeed only bad feelings surg-
ing in roy breast
November, December, and half of January passed away.

Christmas and the New Year had been oelebrated at Gates-
head wiih the usual festive cheer ; presents had been inter-
changed, dinners and evening parties given.* From every
. enjoyment I was, of course, excluded: my share of the
gaiety consisted in witnessing the daily apparelling of Eliza
and Georgiana, and seeing them descend to the drawing-

room, dressed out in thin muslin frocks and scarlet sashes,
. with hair elaborately ringletted ; and afterwards, in listening
to the sound of the piano or the harp played below, to the
! passing to and fro of the butler and footman, to the jinglihg
j of glass and china as refreshments were handed^ to the
- broken hum of conversation as the drawing-room doors
^ opened and closed. When tired of this occupation, I would
j retire from the stairhead to the solitary and silent nursery :
I there, though somewhat sad, I was not miserable. To
j speak truth, I had not the least wish to go into company,
I for in contpany I was very rarely noticed ; and if Bessie hi^
j but been kind and companionable, I should have deemed it
I a treat to spend the evenings quietly with her, instead of
I passing them under the formidable eye of Mrs. Beed, in % ■
I room full of ladies and gentlemen. But Bessie, as soon as
j she had dressed her young ladies, used to take herself off to
the lively regions of the kitchen and housekeeper's room,
I generally bearing the candle along with her. I then sal
I with my doll on my knee, till the fire got low, glandng
« round occasionally to make sure that nothing worse than
j myself haunted the shadowy room ; and when the embers
I sank to a duU red, I undressed hastily, tugging at knots and
• strings as I best might, and sought shelter from oold and
. darkness in my crib. To this crib I* always took my doll;
j human beings must love something, and in the dearth of
. worthier objects of affection, I contrived to find a pleasure

'JDdge from the impression made on me by bw Dorsery
Wee. She was pretty, too, if my recollections of her face
tad person are correct. I remember her as a slim yonng
woman, with black hair, dark eyes, very nice features, and
good, dear complexion ; but she bad a capricioas and hasty
temper, and indifferent ideas of principle or justice : still,
such as she was, I preferred her to any one else at Gates-
bead HalL
It was the fifteenth of January, about nine o'clock in the
morning : Bessie was gone down to breakfast ; my conuns bad
oot yet been summoned to their mammft ; Eliza was patting on
her bonnet and warm garden-coat to go and feed ber poultry,
an occupation of which she was fond : and not less so of selling
the eggs to the housekeeper and hoardlog up the money she
thus obtained. She had a turn for traffic, and a marked
pt > peDsity for saving ; shown not only in the vending at
eggs and chickens, bnt also in driving hard bargains with
the gardener about flower-roots, aeede, and shpa of plants;
that functionary having orders from Mrs. Reed to bay of
bis yoong lady all the products of her parterre she wished

to sell : and Eliza would have sold the hair off her head if
she could have made a handsome profit thereby. As to her
money, she first secreted it in odd comers, wrapped in % rag
or an old curl-paper ; but some of these hoards having been
discovered by the housemaid, Eliza, fearful of one day losing
her valued treasure^ consented to intrust it to her mother,
at a usurious rate of interest — fifty or sixty per cent. ; which
interest she exacted every quarter, keeping her accounts in
a little book with anxious accuracy.
Georgiana sat on a high stool, dressing her hair at the
glass, and interweaving her curls with artificial flowers and
faded feathers, of which she had found a store in a drawer
in the attic. I was making my bed, having received striol
orders from Bessie to get it arranged before she returned
(for Bessie now frequently employed me as a sort of under-
nurserymaid, to tidy the room, dust the chairs, & c). Having
spread the quilt, and folded my night-dress, I went to the
window-seat to put in order some picture-books and doll's
house furniture scattered there ; an abrupt command from
Georgiana to let her playthings alone (for the tiny chain
and mirrors, the fairy plates and cups were her property)
stopped my proceedings ; and then, for lack of other occu-
pation, I fell to breathing on the frost-flowers with which
the window was fretted, and thus clearing a space in the
glass through which I might look out on the grounds, where
all was still and petrified under the influence of a hard frost.
From this window were visible the porter's lodge and
the carriage-road, and just as I had dissolved so much of
the silver-white .foliage veiling the panes as left room to
look out, I saw the gates thrown open and a carriage roll
through. I watched it ascending the drive with indifferenoe :
carriages often came to Gateshead, but none ever brou^t
visitors in whom I was interested ; it stopped in front of
the house, the door-bell rang loudly, the new-comer was
admitted. All this being nothing to me, my vacant atten-
tion soon found Uvelier attraction in the spectacle of a little
hungry robin, which came and chirruped on the twigs of

the leafless oheny-tre« nailed agunst the wall near the
casemenL The remains of my breakfast of bread and milk
stood on the table, and h & viog cnimbled a morsel of roll, I was
tuggiog at the sash to pat out the crumbs on the window-aiU,
when Bessie came running upstairs into the nursery.
'Miss Jane, take o£F your pinafore : what are you doing
there 7 Have you wasbed your bands and face this mora-
tag?'I gave another tug before I & Dsvered, for I wanted
the bird to be secure of its bread : the sash yielded ; I
scattered the crumbs, some on the stone sill, some on the
cherry-tree bough, then, closing the window, I replied : —
'No, Bessie ; I have only just finished dusting.'
'Troublesome, careless child I and what are you doing
now ? You look quite red, as if you had been about some
miscluef : what were you opening the window tor ?'
I was spared the trouble of answering, tor Bessie seemed
in too great a huiry to listen to explan & tioDs : she hauled
me to the waahatoad, inflicted a merciless, but happily brief
scrub on my face and hands with soap, water, and a coarse
towel ; dJBciplined my head with a bnstly brush, denuded
me of my pinafore, and then, hurrying me to the top of the
stairs, bid me go down directly, as I was wanted in the
breakfast- room.
I would have asked who wanted me: I would have
demanded if Mrs. Eeed was there ; but Bessie was already
gone, and had closed the nursery-door upon me : I slowly
descended. For nearly three months I had never been
called to Mrs. Heed's presence: restricted so long to the
nursery, the breakfast, dining, and drawing-rooms were
become for me awful regions, on which it dismayed me to
intrude.
I now stood in the empty hall : before me was the bresk-
tast-room door, and I stopped, intimidated and trembling.
What a miserable httle poltroon had fear, engendered oj
unjust punishment, made of me in those days I I feared
to return to the nursery, and feared to go forward to the
parlour ; ten minutes I stood in agitated hesitation : th«

vehement ringing of ihe breakfast-room bell decided me ^S
I miist enter.
'Who could want me?'I asked inwardly, as with botlu-^
hands I turned the stiff door-handle, which, for a second or ^
two, resisted my efforts.'What should I see besides aunt
Heed in the apartment 7 — a man or a woman 7'The handle
tm-ned, the door unclosed, and passing through and curtsey-
ing low I looked up at — a black pillar I such, bX leasts
appeared to me, at first sight, the straight,* narrow, saUe-
clad shape standing erect on the rug : the grim face at the
top was like a carved mask, placed above the shaft by way
of capital.
Mrs. Beed occupied her usual seat by the fireside : she
made a signal to me to approach : I did so, and she intro-
duced me to the stony stranger with the words :'This is
the little girl respecting whom I applied to you.'
He, for it was a man, turned his head slowly towards
where I stood, and having examined me with the two
inquisitive-looking grey eyes which twinkled under a pair
of bushy brows, said solemnly, and in a bass voice : * Her
size is small: what is her age 7'..«^;'—
'Ten years.''^\,
• So much 7'was the doubtful answer ; & i(^e prolonged
his scrutiny for some minutes. Presentlj^4e addressed
me: ^*
• Your name, Uttle girl ? * ^'-*;/
• Jane Byre, sir.* * •. "'
In uttering these words I looked up : he seemed to me %
tall gentleman; but then I was very little: his featoiee
were large, and they and all the lines of his frame were
equally harsh and prim.
'Well, Jane Eyre, and are you a good child?*
Impossible to reply to this in the afiBrmative : my little
world held a contrary opinion: I was silent Mrs. Beed
answered for me by an expressive shake of the head, adding
soon, * Perhaps the less said on that subject the better, Mr.
Brocklehurst'

j « With pleasure ? Are you fond of it ? *
; * I like Bevelations, and the book of Daniel, and Genesis
^ and Samuel, and a little bit of Exodus, and some parts of
I KiDgs and Chronicles, and Job and Jonah.'.
'And the Psalms? I hope you like them?'
'No, sir.'
'No ? Oh, shocking I I have a little boy, yoimger than
you, who knows six Psalms by heart : and when you ask him
which he would rather have, a gingerbread-nut to eat, or a
verse of a Psalm to learn, he says: " Oh I the verse of a
J Psalm I angels sing Psalms, " says he ; " I wish to be a little
j angel here below ; " he then gets two nuts in recompense for
^ his infant piety.'
j'Psalms are not interesting,'I remarked.
I'That proves you have a wicked heart ; and you most
; pray to God to change it : to give you a new and clean one :
to take away your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh.'
1 I was about to propound a question, touching the
manner m which that operation of changing my heart was
to be performed, when Mrs. Beed interposed, telling me to
sit down ; she then proceeded to carry on the conversation
herself.
'Mr. Brocklehurst, I believe I intimated in the letter
which I wrote to you three weeks ago, that this little girl
I has not quite the character and disposition I could wish:
j should you admit her into Lowood school, I should be glad
. if the superintendent and teachers were requested to keep a
J strict eye on her, and above all, to guard against her worst
. fault, a tendency to deceit I mention this in your hearing,
Jane, that you may not attempt to impose on Mr. Brockle*
hurst'
Well might I dread, well might I dislike Mrs. Beed ; for
- it was her nature to wound me cruelly : never was I happy
in her presence: however carefully I obeyed, however
''" ■■•^-»-* " iWP " ^i
I

strenuously I Etrove to please her, my efforts wore sUU
repulsed and repaid by such sentences as the above. Now,
uttered before a stranger, the accusation cut me to the heart :
I dimly perceived that she was already obliterating hope
from the new phase of existence which she destined me to
enter; I felt, though I oould not have expressed the feeling,
that she was sowing aversion and unldndneBS along my
future path ; I saw myself transformed under Mr. Brochle-
hursl's eye into an artful noxious child, and what could I do
to remedy the injury?
'Nothing, indeed,'thought I, as I straggled to repress
a sob, and hastily vHped away soma tears, the impotent
evidences of my anguiHh.
'Deceit is, indeed, a sad fault in a child,'said ! & .
Brocklehorst ;'it is akin to falsehood, and all liars will
have their portion in the lake burning with fire and brim-
stone : she shall, however, be watched, Mrs. Reed ; I will
speak to Miss Temple and the teaohers.'
'I should wish her to be brought up in a manner suiting
her prospects,'continued my benefactress ;'to be made
useful, to he kept humble : as for tbd vacations, she will,
with your permission, spend them always at Lowood.'
'Your decisions are perfectly judicious, madam,'returned
Mr. Brocklehurst.'Humility is a Christian grace, and one
peculiarly appropriate to the pupils of Lowood : I, therefore,
direct that especial care shall be bestowed on its cultivation
amongst them. I have studied how best to mortify in them
the worldly sentiment of pride ; and, only the other day, 1
bad a pleasing proof of my success. My second daughter,
Augusta, went with her mamma to visit the school, and on
her return she exclaimed'. " Oh, dear papa, how quiet and
plain all the girls at Lowood look ; with their hair combed
behind their ears, and their long pinafores, and those Uttle
holland pockets outside theb frocks—they are almost like
poor people's children I and, " said she, " they looked at my
dress and mamma's, as if they had never seen a silk gown
before. "'

'This is the state of things I quite approve,* returned
Mrs. Beed ;'had I sought all England oyer, I could scarcely
have found a system more exactly fitting a child like Jane
Eyre. Consistency, my dear Mr. Brocklehurst ; I advocate
consistency in all things/
< Consistency, madam, is the first of Christian duties ;
and it has been observed in every arrangement connected
with the establishment of Lowood : plain fare, simple attire,
unsophisticated accommodations, hardy and active habits;
such is the order of the day in the house and its inhabi-
tants.'
'Quite right, sir. I may then depend upon this child
being received as a pupil at Lowood, and there being trained
in conformity to her position and prospects? *
'Madam, you may : she shall be placed in that nursery
of chosen plants — and I trust she will show herself grateful
for the inestimable privilege of her election.'
'I will send her, then, as soon as possible, Mr. BrocUe*
hurst ; for, I assure you, I feel anxious to be relieved of a
responsibility that was becoming too irksome.'
'No doubt, no doubt, madam, and now I wish you good—
morning. I shall return to Brocklehurst Hall in the course
of a week or two : my good friend, the Archdeacon, will noi
permit me to leave him sooner. I shall send Miss Temple
notice that she is to expect a new girl, so that there will be
no difficulty about receiving her. Good-bye.'
'Good-bye, Mr. Brocklehurst ; remember me to Mrs. and
Miss Brocklehurst, and to Augusta and Theodore, and Master
Broughton Brocklehurst.'
'I will, madam. Little girl, here is a book entitled the
*'Child's Guide " ; read it with prayer, especially that part
containing " an accoimt of the awfully sudden death of
Martha G^ , a naughty child addicted to falsehood and
leceit. " •
With these words Mr. Brocklehurst put into my hand a
bhin pamphlet sewn in a cover, and having rung for his
Fbarriage, he departed.

Mrs. Reed and t were left alone : some minutes p
in eilence : she was sewing, I was watching her. Mrs. Reed
might be at that time some six or seven and ihirty ; she was
a woman of robust frame, equare-shouldered and strong-
limbed, not tall, and, tbongh stout, not obese : stie had a
Botnewhat large [ace, the under-jaw being much developed
and very solid ; her brow was low, her chin large and
prominent, mouth and nose sufficiently regular ; under her
light eyebrows glimmered on eye devoid ot ruth ; her skin
was dark and opaque, her hair nearly Qaxcn ; her constita-
tion was sound as a hell — illness never came near her ; she
was an exact, clever manager, her household and tenantry
were thoroughly under her control ; her children, only, at
times defied her authority, and laughed it to scorn; she
dressed well, and had a presence and port calculated ko set
off handsome attire.
Sitting on a low stool, a few yards from her arm-ohair, I
examined her figure ; I perused her features. In my hand
I held the tract containing the sudden death of the Oar :
to which nan.ilive my attention had been pointed as to an
appropriate warning. What had just passed ; what Mrs.
Aeed hod said cohceming me to Mr. Brocklehurst ; the
whole tenor ot their conversation, was recent, raw, and
stinging in my mind ; I had felt every word as acutely as I
had heard it plainly, and a passion of resentment fomented
now within me.
Mrs. Beed looked up from her work ; her eye settled on
mine, her fingers at the same time suspended their nimble
movements.
'Qo out of the room ; return to the nursery,'was her
mandate. My look or something else must have struck her
as offensive, for she spoke with extreme, tbongh suppressed
irritation. I got up, I went to the door; I came back
again ; I walked to the window, across the room, then close'
Qp to her.
Speak I must ; I had been trodden on severely, and mutt
turn : but how ? What strength had I to dart retaliation at

my antagonist ? I gathered my energies and lamiched them
in this blunt sentence : —'I am not deceitful : if I were, I
should say I loved you ; but I declare I do not love you : I
dislike you the worst of anybody in the world except John
Kecd ; and this book about the liar, you may give to your
girl, Georgiana, for it is she who teUs lies, and not L'
Mrs. Eeed's hands still lay on her work inactive : her eye
of ice continued to dwell freezingly on mine.
'What more have you to say 7'she asked, rather in Uie
tone in which a person might Cbddress an opponent of adult
age than such as is ordinarily used to a child.
That eye of hers, that voice stirred every antipathy I
had. Shaidng from head to foot, thrilled with ungovernable
excitement, I continued : —'I am glad you are no relation of
mine : I will never call you aunt again as long as I live. I
\sill never come to see you when I am grown up ; and if
any one asks me how I liked you, and how you treated me,
I will say the very thought of you makes me sick, and thai
you treated me with miserable cruelty.'
'How dare you affirm that, Jane Eyre?*
'How dare I, Mrs. Beed 7 How dare I ? Because it is
the truth. You think I have no feelings, and that I can do
without one bit of love or kindness ; but I cannot live so : and
you have no pity. I shall remember how you thrust me beck
— roughly and violently thrust me back — into the red-room,
and locked me up there, to my dying day ; though I was in
agony ; though I cried out, while suffocating with distress,
" Have mercy I Have mercy, aunt Beed I " And that punish-
ment you made me suffer because your wicked boy struck
me — ^knocked me down for nothing. I will tell anybody
who asks me questions this exact tale. People think yoa
^ a good woman, but you are bad ; hard-hearted. Tim are

! to exult, with the strangest sense of freedom, of triumph, I
/ ever felt. It seemed as if an invisible bond had burst, and
y that I had struggled out into unhoped-for liberty. Nol

the same ridge, black and blasted after the flames are dead,
would have represented as meetly my subsequent condition,
when half an hour's silence and reflection had shown me
the madness of my conduct, and the dreariness of my hatred
and hating position.
Something of vengeance I had tasted for the first time ;
as aromatic \vine it seemed, on swallowing, warm and racy :
its after-flavour, metallic and corroding,, gave me a sensa-
tion as if I had been poisoned. Willingly would I now
have gone and asked Mrs. Beed's pardon ; but I knew,
partly from experience and partly from instinct, that was
the way to make her repulse me with double scorn, thereby
re-exciting every turbulent impulse of my nature.
I would fain exercise some better faculty than that d
fierce speaking ; fain find nourishment for some less fiendish
feeling than that of sombre indignation. I took a book —
some Arabian tales ; I sat down and endeavoured to read.
I could make no sense of the subject ; my own thoughts
swam always between me and the page I had usually found
fascinating. I opened the glass^loor in the breakfast-room :
the shrubbery was quite still: the black frost reigned,^
unbroken by sun or breeze, through the grounds. I covered
my head and arms with the skirt of my frock, and went out
to walk in a part of the plantation which was quite seques-
tered: but I found no pleasure in the silent trees, the
falling fir-cones, the congealed relics of autumn, russet
leaves, swept by past winds in heaps, and now stiffened
together. I leaned against a gate, and looked into an empty
field where no sheep were feeding, where the short grass
was nipped and blanched. It was a very grey day ; a most
opaque sky,'ending on snaw,'canopied all ; thenoe flakes
fell at intervals, which settled on the hard path and on the
hoary lea without melting. I stood, a wretched child
enough, whispering to myself over and over again, * What
shall I do ?— what shall I do 7 *
All at once I heard a clear voice call,'Miss Jane I where

The moon was set, and it was very dark ; Besde carried
a lantern, whose light glanced on wet steps and gravel road

morning : my teeth chattered as I hastened down the drive.
There was a light in the porter's lodge : when we reached

to trust her so far alone.*
The coach drew up ; there it was at the gates with its —
four horses and its top laden with passengers : the guaid
and co£kchman loudly urged haste ; my trunk was hoisted
up ; I was taken from Bessie's neck, to which I clung with
kisses.
'Be sure and take good care of her/ cried she to the
guard, as he lifted me into the inside.
'Ay, ay I'was the answer : the door was slapped to» a
voice exclaimed,'All right,'and on we drove, l^us was I .
severed from Bessie and Gateshead : thus whirled away to
unknown, and, as I then deemed, remote and mysterious
regions.
I remember but little of the journey : I only know that
the day seemed to me of a preternatural length, and thai we
appeared to travel over hundreds of miles of road. We
passed through several towns, and in one, a very large one,
the coach stopped; the horses were taken out^ and the

passengers alighted to dine. I vra > s carried into an inn,
where the guard wanted me to have some dinner ; but, as
I had DO appetite, he left me ia on immense room with a
fireplace at each end, a chandelier pendent Irom the ceiling,
and a little red gallery high up against the wall filled mth
tnusical instrumentB. Here I walked about tor a long time,
feeling very strange, and mortally apprehensive of some one
coming in and kidnapping me ; for I beheved in kidnappers,
their exploits having frequently figured in Bessie's fireside
chronicles. At last the guard returned : ouce more I was
stowed away in the coach, my protector mounted his own
eeat, sounded his hollow bom, and away we rattled over the
'stony street'of L .
The afternoon came on wet and somewhat misty i as it
waned into dusk I began to feel that we were getting very
hr indeed from Gateshead; we ceased to pass through
(owob; the country changed; great grey hills heaved up
roiuid the horizon : as twilight deepened we desceoded a
valley, dark mth wood, and long after night had overclouded
the prospect I heard a wild wind rushing amongst trees.
Lulled by the sound, I at last dropped asleep : I had not
long slumbered when the sudden cessation of motion awoke
me : the coach-door was open, and a person Uke a servant
was standing at it : I saw her face and dress by the hght of
the tamps.
'Is there a little girl called Jane Eyre here?'she asked.
I answered'Yes,'and was then lifted out ; my trunk was
handed down, and the coach instantly drove away.
I was stiff with long sitting, and bewildered with the
Doise and motion of the coach : gathering my faculties, I
looked about me. Bain, wind, and darkness filled the air ;
nevertheless, I dimly discerned a wall before me and a door
open in it ; through this door I passed with my new guide :
she shut and locked it behind her. There was now visible
a house or houses — for the building spread far — with
many windows, and lights burning in some ; we went up a
broad pebbly path, splashing wet, and were admitted at a

door ; then the servant led me through a passage into a
room with a fire, where she left me alone.
I stood and warmed my numbed fingers over the blaae,
then I looked round ; there was no candle, but the uncertain
light £rom the hearth showed, by intervals, papered walls,
carpet, curtains, shining mahogany furniture: it was a
parlour, not so spacious or splendid as the drawing-room at
Gateshead, but comfortable enough. I was puzzling io
make out the subject of; a picture on the wall, when the
door opened, and an individual carrying a light entered;
another followed close behind.
The first was a tall lady with dark hair, dark eyes, and
a pale and large forehead ; her figure was partly enveloped
in a shawl, her countenance was grave, her bearing erect
'The child is very young to be sent alone,'said she,
putting her candle down on the table. She considered me
attentively for a minute or two, then further added :
'She had better be put to bed soon ; she looks tired :
'are you tired?'she asked, placing her hand on my
shoulder.
'A little, ma'am.*
'And hungry too, no doubt : let her have some supper'
before she goes to bed. Miss Miller. Is this the first time
you have left your parents to oome to school, my little
girl?'
I explained to her that I had no parents. She inqtdred
how long they had been dead ; then how old I was, what
was my name, whether I could read, write, and sew a little :
then she touched my cheek gently with her forefinger, and
saying, < She hoped I should be a good child,'dismissed me
along with Miss Miller.
The lady I had left might be about twenty-nine ; the one
who went with me appeared some years younger : the first
impressed me by her voice, look, and air. Miss Miller was
more ordinary ; ruddy in complexion, though of a careworn
countenance ; hiuried in gait and action, like one who had
always a multiplicity of tasks on hand : she looked, indeed.

what I & tterw & rds found she really was, an under-teacher.
Led by her, I passed from cotnpaxtmeDt to compai-tment,
from passage to passage, of a large and irregular building ;
till, emerging from the total and somewhat dreary silence
pervading that portion of the house we had traversed, we
came upon the hum of many voices, and presently entered
a wide, long room, with groat deal tables, two at each end,
on each of which burnt a pair of candles, and seated alt
round on benches a congregation of girls of every age, from
nine or ten to twenty. Seen by the dim light of the dips,
their number tome appeared countless, though not in reality
exceeding eighty; they were uniformly dressed in brown
stuff frocks of quaint fashion, and long holland pinafores.
It was the hour of study; they were engaged in conning
over their to-morrow's task, and the hum I bad heard was
the combined result of their whispered repetitions.
Miss Miller signed to me to sit on a bench near the door,
tbao waUdog up to the top of the long room, she cried out :
'Monitors, collect the lesson-books and put them away I'
Four tall ^Is arose from different tables, and going
round, gatbei'ed the books and removed them. Miss Miller
again gave the word of command :
'Monitors, fetch the supper-trays 1'
The tail ^Is went out, and returned presently, eacb
bearing a tray, with portions of something, I knew not what,
arranged thereon, and a pitcher of water and mug in the
middle of each tray. The portions were handed round ;
those who liked took a draught of the water, the mug being
common toalL When it came to my turn, I di'ank, for I
was thirsty, bat did not touch the food, excitement and
fatigue rendering me incapable of eating : I now saw, how-
ever, that it was a thin oaten cake, shared into fragments.
The meal over, prayers were read by Miss MiLer, and
the classes filed off, two and two, upstairs. Overpowered
by this time with weariness, I scarcely noticed what sort of
a place the* bedroom was ; except that, like the schoolroom,
I saw it was very long. To-night I was to be Miss Miller's

bedfellow ; she helped me to undress : when laid down I
glanced at the long rows of beds, each of which was quiddy
filled with two occupants ; in ten minutes the single li|^t
was extinguished ; amidst silence and complete darkness, I
fell asleep.
The night passed rapidly : I was too tired even to dream ;
I only once awoke to hear the wind rave in furious gust8»
and the rain fall in torrents, and to ba sensible that IGss
Miller had taken her place by my side. When I again un-
closed my eyes, a loud bell was ringing : the girls were up
and dressing ; day had not yet begun to dawn, and a rush-
light or two burnt in the room. I too rose reluctantly ; it
was bitter cold, and I dressed as well as I could tor shiver-
ing, and washed when there was a basin at liberty, which
did not occur soon, as there was but one basin to six girls on
the stands down the middle of the room. Again the bell
rang : all formed in file, two and two, and in that order
descended the stairs and entered the cold and dimly-lit
schoolroom : here prayers were read by Miss Miller; after-
wards she called out : —'Form classes I *
A great tumult succeeded for some minutes, during which-.
Miss Miller repeatedly exclaimed,'Silence I'and'Order I *
When it subsided, I saw them all drawn up in four semi-
circles, before four chairs, placed at the four tables ; all held
books in their hands, and a great book, like a Bible, lay on
each table, before the vacant seat. A pause of some seconds
succeeded, filled up by the low, vague hum of numbers ;
Miss Miller walked from class to class, hushing this in-
definite sound.
A distant bell tinkled : immediately three ladies entered
the room, each walked to a table and took her seat ; Miss
Miller assumed the fourth vacant chair, which was that
nearest the door, and around which the smallest of the
children were assembled : to this inferior class I was called,
and placed at the bottom of it.
Business now began : the day's Collect was repeated,
then certain texts of Scripture were said, and to these
^^•'^ " ^'" •^^■••■•^■•^^'•^•■i^^WBPiWP*^

eucceeded a protracted reading of chapters in the Bible, which
l & sted an hour. By the time that exercise was terminated
day had fully dawned. The indefatigable boll now sounded
for the fourth time : the classes were marshalled and
marched into another room to breakfast : how glad I was to
behold a prospect of getting something to eat 1 I was now
nearly sick from inanition, having taken so little the day
before.
The refectory was a great, low-ceiled, gloomy room ; on
two long tables smoked Irasins of something hot, which, how-
ever, to my dismay, sent forth an odour far from inviting,
I saw a universal manifestation of discontent when the
fumes of the repast met the nostrils of those destined to
swallow it : from the van of the procession, the tall girls
of the first class, rose the whispered words : —'Disgusting !
The porridge is burnt again 1'
■ Silence I'ejaculated a voice ; not that of Miss Miller,
but one of the upper teachers, a little and dark personage,
smartly dressed, but of somewhat morose aspect, who iti-
stallod herself at the top of one table, while a more buxom
lady presided at the other. I looked in vain for her I had
first seen the night before ; she was not viable : Miss Miller
occupied the foot of the table where I sat, and a strange,
foreign looking, elderly lady, the French teacher, as I after-
wards found, took the corresponding seat at the other board.
A long grace was said and a hymn sung ; then a serroDt
brought in some tea for the teachers, and the meal began.
Ravenous, and now very faint, I devoured a spoonful or
two of my portion without thinking of its taste ; but the
first edge of hunger blunted, I perceived I bad got in hand a
nauseous meas : burnt porridge is almost as bad as rotten
potatoes; famine itself soon sickens over it. The spoons
were moved slowly : I saw each girl taste her food and try
to swallow it ; but in most cases the effort was soon re-
linquished. Breakfast was over, and none had breakfasted.
Thanks being returned for what we had not got, and a
second hymn chanted, the refectory was evacuated for the

schoolroom. I was one of the last to go out, and in passing
the tables, I saw one teacher take a basin of the porridge
and taste it ; she looked at the others ; all their countenances
expressed displeasure, and one of them, the stout one^
whispered : —'Abominable stuff I How shameful I'
A quarter of an hour passed before lessons again began,
during which the schoolroom was in a glorious tumult ; for
tliat space of time, it seemed to be permitted to talk loud
and more freely, and they used their privilege. The whole
conversation ran on the breakfast, which one and all abused
roundly. Poor things ! it was the sole consolation they had.
Miss Miller was now the only teacher in the room : a group
of great girls standing about her, spoke with serious and
sullen gestures. I heard the name of Mr. Brocklehurst pro-
nounced by some lips ; at which Miss Miller shook her head
disapprovingly ; but she made no great effort to check the
general wrath : doubtless she shared in it.
A clock in the schoolroom struck nine ; Miss Miller lefl
her circle, and standing in the middle of the room, cried :—
'Silence ! To your seats I'
Discipline prevailed : in five minutes the confused
throng was resolved into order, and comparative silence "
quelled the Babel clamour of tongues. The upper teachers
now punctuaUy resmned their posts : but still, eJl seemed to
wait. Banged on benches down the sides of the room, the
eighty girls sat motionless and erect : a quaint assemblage
they appeared, all with plain locks combed from their faces,
not a curl visible ; in brown dresses, made high and sur-
rounded by a narrow tucker about the throat, with little
pockets of hoUand (shaped something like a Highlander's
purse) tied in front of their frocks, and destined to serve the
purpose of a work-bag: all too wearing woollen stockings
and country-made shoes, fastened with brass buckles.
Alx > ve twenty of those clad in this costume were full-grown
girls, or rather young women ; it suited them ill, and gave
an air of oddity even to the prettiest.
I was still looking at them, and also at intervals

The superintendent of Lowood (for such was this lady)
having taken her seat before a pair of globes placed on ona
of the tables, summoned the first class round her, and oom-
menced giving a lesson in geography; the lower dasses
were called by the teachers : repetitions in history, grammar,
& c., went on for an hour ; writing and arithmetio succeeded,
and music lessons were given by Miss Temple tp some of
the elder girls. The dmration of each lesson was measured
by the clock, which at last struck twelve. The superin-
tendent rose : —'I have a word to address to the pupils,'said
she.
The tumult of cessation from lessons was already break-
ing forth, but it sank at her voice. She went on : — * Yon
had this morning a breakfast which you could not eat ; you
must be hungry. I have ordered that a lunch of bread and
cheese shaU be served to alL'
The teachers looked at her with a sort of surprise.
'It is to be done on my responsibility,'she added, in an
explanatory tone to them, and immediately afterwards left
the room.
The bread and cheese was presently brought in and dia-.
tributed, to the high delight and refreshment of the whole
school. The order was now given,'To the garden I'Each
put on a coarse straw bonnet, with strings of coloured calioo,
and a cloak of grey frieze. I was'similarly equipped, and,
following the stream, I made my way into the open air.
The garden was a wide indosure, surrounded with walls
so high as to exclude every glimpse of prospect ; a covered
verandah ran down one side, and broad walks bordered a
middle space divided into scores of little beds : these beda
were assigned as gardens for the pupils to cultivate, and
each bed had an owner. When full of flowers they would
doubtless look pretty; but now, at the latter end of January,
all was wintry blight and brown decay. I shuddered as I
stood and looked round me : it was an inclement day for
outdoor exercise ; not positively rainy, but darkened by a
drizzling yellow fog; all underfoot was still soaking wet with

the floods of yeaterday. The stronger among the girU ran
about and engaged in active games, but sundry pale a,nd thin
ones herded together for shelter and warmth in the veraudah ;
and amongst these, aa the dense mist penetrated to their
Bhivering frames, I heard frequently the sound of a hollow
oough.
As yet I had epokea to no one, nor did anybody seem to
take notice of me ; I stood lonely enough : hut to that feeling
oi isolation I was accustomed ; it did not oppress me moch.
I leant against a pillar of the verandah, drew my grey mantle
close about me, and, trying to forget the cold which nipped
me without, and the unsatisfied hunger which gnawed me
within, delivered myself up to the employment of watching
and thinking. My refieotioDS were too undefined and frag-
mentary to merit record : I hardly yet knew where I was ;
Gateshead and my past life seemed floated away to an im-
measurable distance ; the present was vague and strange,
uid of iba future I could form no conjecture. I looked
round the convent-like garden, and then up at the house ; a
large building, hali of which seemed grey and old, the other
half quite new. The new part, containing the schoolroom
and dormitory, was lit by roullioned and latticed windows,
which gave it a church-like aspect ; a stone tablet oyer the
door, bore this inscription :—
LOWOOD INgTITUTION.
I read these words over and over again -. I felt that an
explanation belonged to them, and was unable tolly to
penetrate their import. I was still pondering the sign^ca-
tion of'Institution,'and endeavouring to make out a con-
nection between the first words and the verse of Scripture,
when the sound of a cough close behind roe, made me torn
my head. I saw a girl sitting on a stone bench near ; she

JANE EYBE 6S
was bent over a book, on ihe perusal of which she seemed
intent : from where I stood I oould see the title — it was
'Easselas ;'a name that stmok me as strange, and conse-
quently attractive. In turning a leaf she happened to kx > k
up, and I said to her directly : — * Is your book interesting? *
I had already formed the intention of asking her to lend it
to me some day.
< I like it,'she answered, after a pause of a second or
two, during which she examined me.
'What is it about ?'I continued. I hardly know where
I found the hardihood thus to open a conversation vrith a
stranger ; the step was contrary to my nature and habits :
but I think her occupation touched a chord of sympathy
somewhere ; for I too liked reading, though of a frivolous
and childish kind; I could not digest or comprehend the
serious or substantiaL
'You may look at it/ replied the (^1, offering me the
book.
I did so; a brief examination convinced me that the
contents were less taking than the title :'Rasselas'looked
dull to my trifling taste ; I saw nothing about fairies, nothing
about genii; no bright variety seemed spread over the
closely printed pages. I retmrned it to her ; she received i%
quietly, and without saying anything she was about to
relapse into her former studious mood : again I ventured to
disturb her : —'Can you tell me what the writing on thai
stone over the door means ? What b Lowood Instituticm ?'
'This house where you are come to live.'
'And why do they call it Institution ? Is it in any way
different from other schools ?'
'It is partly a charity-school : you and I, and all the rest
of us, are charity children. I suppose you are an orphan :
are not either your father or your mother dead ?'
'Both died before I can remember.'
'Well, all the girls here have lost either one or both
parents, and this is called an institution for educating
orphans.'

comes from Lisle, in France, and teaches French.*

* Well enough/
'Do you like the little black one, and the Madame ?

* Two years/
'Are you an orphan ? *
* My mother is dead.'
* Are you happy here ?'
'You ask rather too many questions. I have given you
answers enough for the present : now I want to read.'
But at the moment the summons sounded for dinner :
all re-entered the house. The odour which now filled the
refectory was scarcely more appetising than that which had
regaled our nostrils at breakfast : the dinner was served in
two huge tin-plated vessels, whence rose a strong steam
redolent of rancid fat. I found the mess to consist of
indiflerent potatoes and strange shreds of rusty meat, mixed
j and cooked together. Of this preparation a tolerably
abundant plateful was apportioned to each pupiL I ale
what I could, and wondered within myself whether every
day's fare would be Uke this.
After dinner, we immediately adjourned to the school-
room : lessons recommenced, and were continued till five
o'clock.
The only marked event of the afternoon was, that I saw

The next day commenced as before, getting up and dresmng
by rush-light ; but this morning we were obliged to dispense
with the ceremony of washing : the water in the pitchers
was frozen. A change had takea place in the weatiier the
preceding evening, and a keen north-east wind, whistling
through the crevices of our bedroom windows all night long^
had made ns shiver in our beds, and turned the contents of
the ewers to ice.
Before the long hour and a half of prayers and BiUe
reading was over, I felt ready to perish with cold. Break-
fast-time came at last, and this morning the porridge was
not burnt; the quality was eatable, the quantity small;
how small my portion seemed I I wished it had been
doubled.
In the course of the day I was enrolled a member of the
fourth class, and regular tasks and occupations were assigned
me : hitherto, I had only been a spectator of the proceedings
at Lowood, I was now to become an actor therein. At firsts
j being little accustomed to learn by heart, the lessons ap-
. peared to me both long and difficult : the frequent change
I from task to task, too, bewildered me; and I was glad,
j when, about three o'clock in the afternoon. Miss Smith put
j into my hands a border of muslin two yards long, together
i with needle, thimble, & o., and sent me to sit in a quiel
I comer of the schoolroom, with directions to hem the same,
j At that hour most of the others were sewing likewise ; but
one class still stood round Miss Scatcherd's chair reading,
and as all was quiet, the subject of their lessons could be
heard, together Mrith the manner in which each girl acquitted

& c. ; till uhe dismissed me, I could not pursae my observa*
! tions on Miss Scatcherd's movements. When I retained to
my seat, that lady was just delivering an order, of whioh I
did not catch the import; but Burns inmiediately left the
class, and, going into the small inner room where the books
. were kept, returned in half a minute, carrying in her hand a
! bundle of twigs tied together at one end. This.ominous tool
I she presented to Miss Scatoherd with a respectful curtsy ;
j then she quietly, and without being told, unloosed her
j pinafore, and the teacher instantly and sharply inflicted on
her neck a dozen strokes with the bunch of twigs. Not a
I tear rose to Burns'eye; and, while I paused from my
r sewing, because my fingers quivered at this spectacle with a
j sentiment of unavailing and impotent anger, not a feature of
her pensive face altered its ordinary expression.
'Hardened girl!'exclaimed Miss Scatcherd;'nothing
can correct you of your slatternly habits: carry the rod
j away.*
} Burns obeyed : I looked at her narrowly as she emerged
I from the book-closet ; she was just putting back her hand*
. kerchief into her pocket, and the trace of a tear glistened on
her thin cheek.
The play -hour in the evening I thought the pleasantesi
fraction of the day at Lowood : the bit of bread, the draught
• of coffee swallowed at five o'clock had revived vitality, if it had
■ not satisfied hunger ; the long restraint of the day was
j slackened ; the schoolroom felt warmer than in the morning
I —its fires being allowed to burn a little more brightly to
j supply, in some measure, the place of candles, not yet
i introduced; the ruddy gloaming, the licensed uproar, the
confusion of many voices, gave one a welcome sense of
liberty.
On the evening of the day on which I had seen Miss
Scatcherd flog her pupil. Bums, I wandered as usual among
the forms and tables and laughing groups without a oom-
I panion, yet not feeling lonely ; when I passed the windows,
I now and then lifted a blind and looked out ; it snowed fast^

B. drift was already forming against the lower pane.t ; puttiof;
my oar close to the window, I could distiaguish from the
gleeful tumult within, the disconsolate moan of the wind out-
nde.
Probably, if I had lately left a good home and kind
parents, this would have been the hour when I should most
keenly have regretted the separation : that wiud would then
have saddened my heart ; this obscure chaos would have
disturbed my peace : as it was, I derived from both a strange
excitement, and reckless and feverish, I wished the wind to
howl more wildly, the gloom to deepen to darkness, and the
confusion to rise to clamour.
Jumping over forms, and oreepiog under tables, I made
my way to one of the fire-places : there, kneeling by the higb
wire fender, I found Bums, absorbed, sileut, abstracted from
all round her by the companionship of a book, which she
read by the dim glare of the embers.
'Is it Btill " Basselas " ?'I asked, coming behind her.
'Yes,'Ehe said,'and I have just finished it.'
And in five minutes more she shut it up, I was glad of
this.
'Now,'thought I,'I can perhaps get her to talk.'I sat
down by her on the floor.
'What is your name besides Bums ?'
• Helen.*
'Do you come a long way from here ?'
'I come from a place further north ; quite on the borders
of Scotland.'
'Will you ever go back ?'
'I hope BO ; but nobody can be sure of the future.'
'You must wish to leave Ixiwood 7'
'No : why should I ? I was seat to Lowood to get sd
education ; and it would be of no use going away until 1
have attained that object.'
'But that teacher, Miss Scatcherd, is so cruel to you 7'
'Cruel? Not at all t She is severe: slie dislikes mj
lanlU.'

'And if I were in your place I should dislike her; I
should resist her ; if she struck me with that rod, I should
get it from her hand ; I should break it under her nose**
I < Probably you would do nothing of the sort : but if you

'But then it seems disgraceful to be flogged, and to be

'Yet it would be your duty to bear it, if you could nol
avoid it : it is weak and silly to say you cannot bear what
it is your fate to be required to bear.'
I beard her with wonder : I could not comprehend this
doctrine of endurance ; and still less could I understand or
I sympathise with the forbearance she expressed for her
j chastiser. Still I felt that Helen Bums considered things
1 by a light invisible to my eyes. I suspected she might be
right and I wrong; but I would not ponder the matter
deeply : like Felix, I put it off to a more convenient season.
'You say you have faults, Helen : what are they? To
me you seem very good.'•
'Then learn from me, not to judge by appearances : I
I am, as Miss Scatcherd said, slatternly ; I seldom put, and
i never keep, things in order ; I am careless ; I forget rules T

i and sometimes I say, like you, I cannot bear to be subjected

Miss Scatcherd, who is naturally neat, punctual, and par-
ticular.'
'And cross and cruel,'I added ; but Helen Bums would
not admit my addition : she kept ulence.
'Is Miss Temple as severe to you as Miss Scatcherd?*

At the ntteraDoe of ^Uaa Tempte'B name, a Boft smile
flitted over her grave face.
'Misa Temple is full of goodness : it pains her to be
severe to any one, even the worst in the school ; she sees
my errors, and tells me of them gently ; and, if I do any-
thing worthy of praise, she gives me my meed liberally.
One strong proof of my wretchedly defective nature is, that
even her expostulations, so mild, so rational, have not
influence to cure me of my faults; and even her praise,
though I value it most highly, cannot stimulate me to con-
tinued care and foresight.'
'That is curious,'said I :'it is so easy to be care-
ful'
'For you I have no doubt it is. I observed you in your
class this morning, and saw you were closely attentive :
your thoughts never seemed to wander while Miss Miller
explained the lesson and questioned you. Now, mine coa-
tinually rove away : when I should be listening to Miss
Seatcberd, and collecting all she says with assiduity, often I
lose the very sound of her voice ; I fall into a sort of dream.
Sometimes I think I am in Northumberland, mid that the
noises I hear round me are the bubbling of a little brook
which runs through Deepden near our house ; — then, when
it comes to my turn to reply, I have to be wakened ; and,
having heard nothing of what was read for listening to the
visionary brook, I have no answer ready.'
'Yet how well you replied this afternoon.'
'It was mere chance : the subject on which we had been
reading had interested me. This afternoon, instead of
dreaming of Deepdea, I was wondering how a man who
wished to do right could act bo unjustly and unwisely as
Charles the First sometimes did; and I thought what a
pity it was that, with hia integrity and consi^entiouBness, he
could see no farther than the prerogatives of the crown- If
be bad but been able to look to a distance, and see to what
they call the spirit of the age was tending I Still, I like
Charles — I respect him — I pity him, poor murdered king 1
JANE EYBB 63
Yes, his enemies were ihe worst : they shed blood ibey had
no right to shed. How dared they kill him I'
Helen was talking to herself now : she had forgoUen I
could not very well understand her — that I was ignorant, or
nearly so, of the subject she discussed. I recalled her to my
level
i'And when Miss Temple teaches you, do your thoughts
wander then ?'
< No, certainly, not often; because Miss Temple has
generally something to say which is newer than my own
reflections : her language is singularly agreeable to me, and
the information she commimicates is often just what I wished
to gain/
'Well, then, with Miss Temple you are good ?'
'Yes, in a passive way : I make no effort ; I follow as
inclination guides me. There is no merit in such goodness.*
I'A great deal : you are good to those who are good to
I you. It is all I ever desire to be. If people were always
kind and obedient to those who are cruel and unjust, the
wicked people would have it all their own way ; they would
never feel sifraid, and so they would never alter, but would
grow worse and worse. When we are struck at without a
reason, we should strike back again very hard ; I am sure
we should— so hard as to teach the person who struck us
never to do it again.'
'You will change your mind, I hope, when you grow
j older : as yet you are but a little untaught girL*
I'But I feel this, Helen : I must dislike those who, what-
I ever I do to please them, persist in disliking me; -I must
resist those who punish me unjustly. It is as natural as
'. that I should love those who show me affection, or submit to
punishment when I feel it is deserved.'
'Heathens and savage tribes hold that dootrine; but
Qiristians and civilised nations disown il'
* How ? I don't understand.'
'It is not violence that best overcomes hate — nor ven-
geance that most certainly heals injury.'

'What then ?'- ^
'Bead the New Testament, and observe what Christ
Bays, and how he acts ; make Ms word yoor mle, and his
conduct your example.'
'What does he say ?'
'Love your enemies ; bless them that curse you ; do good
to them that hate you and despitetoUy use you.'
'Then I should love Mrs. Beed, which I cannot do ; I
should bless her son John, which is impossible.'
In her turn, Helen Butob aeked me to espWn, and I
proceeded forthwith to pour out, in my own way, the tale
of my Bufferings and resentments. Bitter and truculent
when escited, I spoke as I felt, without reserve or softening.
Helen heard me patiently to the end : I expected she
would then moke a remark, but she said nothing.
'Well,'I asked impatiently,'is not Mrs. Beed a hard-
hearted, bad woman ?'
'She has been unldnd to yon, do doubt; because, yon
flee, she dislikes your cast of chsjracter, as Miss Scatcherd
does mine ; but how miDUtely you remember all she has
done and said to you I What a singularly deep impression
her injustice seems to have made on your heart 1 No ill-
usage so brands its record on my feelings. Would yon not
be happier if you tried to forget her severity, together with
the passionate emotiona it excited? Life appears to me too
short to be spent in nursing animosity, or registering wrongs.
We are, and must be, one and all, burdened with faults in
this world ; but the time will soon come when, I trust, we
shall put them off in putting off our corruptible bodies ;
when debasement and sin will fall from us with this
cumbrous frame of flesh, and only the spark of the spirit will
remain, — the impalpable principle of Ufe and thought, pure
u when it left the Creator to inspire the creature : whence
it came it wiU return ; perhaps agun to be communicated
to some being higher than man — perhaps to pass through
gradations of glory, from the pale human soul to brighten to
the seraph I Surely it will never, on the contrary, be suffered

to degenerate from man to fiend? No; I cannot belieye
that : I hold another creed ; which no one ever taught me,
aud which I seldom mention ; but in which I delight, and
to which I cling: for it extends hop^ to all: it makes
Eternity a rest — a mighty home, not a terror and an abyss.
Besides, with this creed, I can so clearly distinguish between
the criminal and his crime ; I can so sincerely forgive the
fii*8t while I abhor the last : with this creed revenge never
woiTies my heart, degradation never too deeply ^sgusts me,
injustice never crushes me too low : I live in calm, looking
to the end.*
Helen's head, always drooping, sank a little lower as she
finished this sentence. I saw by her look she wished no
longer to talk to me, but rather to converse with her own
thoughts. She was not allowed much time for meditation :
a monitor, a great rough girl, presently came up, exclaiming
in a strong Cumberland accent, —
'Helen Bums, if you don't go and put your drawer in
order, and fold up your work this minute, I'll tell Miss
Scatcherd to come and look at it I'
Helen sighed as her reverie fled, and getting up, obeyed
the monitor without reply as without delay.

Sundays were dreary days in that wintry season. We
had to walk two miles to Brocklebridge Church, where our
patron officiated. We set out cold, we arrived at ohnroh
colder : during the morning service we became ahnost para-
lysed. It was too far to return to dinner, and an allowance
of cold meat and bread, in the same penurious proportion
observed in our ordinary meals, was served round between
the services.
At the close of the afternoon service we returned by an
exposed and hilly road, where the bitter winter wind, blowing
over a range of snowy summits to the north, almost flayed
the skin from our faces.
I can remember Miss Temple walking lightly and rapidly
along our drooping line, her plaid cloak, which the frosty
wind fluttered, gathered close about her, and encouraging
us, by precept and example, to keep up our spirits, and
march forward, as she said,'like stalwart soldiers.'The
other teachers, poor things, were generally themselves too
much dejected to attempt the task of cheering others.
How we longed for the light and heat of a blazing fire
when we got back ! But, to the little ones at least, this was
denied : each hearth in the schoolroom was immediately
surrounded by a double row of great girls, and behind them
the younger children crouched in groups, wrapping their
starved arms in their pinafores.
A little solace came at tea-time, in the shape of a double
ration of bread — a whole, instead of a half, slice — with the
delicious addition of a thin scrape of butter : it was the heb*
domadal treat to which we all looked forward from Sabbath
to Sabbath. I generally contrived to reserve a moiety of this
bounteous repast for myself ; but the remainder I was in-
variably obliged to part with.
The Sunday evening was spent in repeating, by heart,
the Church Catechism, and the fifth, sixth, and seventh
chapters of St. Matthew ; and in listening to a long sermon,
read by Miss Miller, whose irrepressible yawns attested her
weariness. A frequent interlude of these performac'wes was

the enactmeat of the part of Eutychus by some half dosed
of little girls ; who, overpowered with sleep, would fajl down,
if not out of the third loft, yet off the fourth form, and be
taken up baJf dead. The remedy was, to thrust them
forward into the centre of the schoolroom, and oblige theni
to Btaad there till the sermon was finished. Sometimes
(beii feet failed them, and they sank together in a heap ;
they were then propped up with the monitors'high stools.
I h & ve not yet aUuded to the visits of Mr. Brockleburst ;
and indeed that gentleman was from home during the greater
part of the first month after my an-ival ; perhaps prolonging
his stay with bis friend the archdeacon ; bis absence was a
relief to me. I need not say that I had my own reasons for
dreading his coming : but come be did at last.
One afternoon (I had then been three weeks at Lowood), aa
I was sitting with a slate in my hand, puzzling over a snm
in long division, my eyes, raised in abstraction to the window,
caught sight of a figure just passmg: I recognised almost
instinctively that gaunt outbne; and when two minutes
after, all the school, teachers included, rose en masse, it was
not necessary for me to look up in order to ascertain whose
entr & nce they thus greeted. A long stride measured the
schoolroom, and presently be»de Miss Temple, who herself
had risen, stood the siune black column which bad frowned
on me so ominously from the heai-th-mg of Gateshead. I
now glanced ddeways at this piece of architecture. Yes, I
wu right : it was Mr. Brocklehurst, buttoned up in a sur-
tout, and looking longer, narrower, and more rigid than
ever.
I had my own reasona for being dismayed at this appari-
tion : too well I remembered the perfidious hints given by
Mrs. Beed about my dispodtion, tx. ; the promise pledged
by Mr. Brocklehurst to apprise Miss Temple and the teachers
of my vicious nature. All along I had been dreading the
fulfilment of this promise, — I bad been looking out daily for
the'Coming Man,'whose information respecting my past
liio ,a£.l oonversatioD was to brand me as a bad child foi

ever : now there he was. He stood at Miss Temple's dda ;
he was speaking low in her ear: I did not donbi he was
making disclosures of my villainy ; and I watched her eye
with painful anxiety, expecting every moment to see its dark
orb turn on me a glance of repugnance and oontempt. I
listened too ; and as I happened to be seated quite at the
top of the room, I caught most of what he said : its import
relieved me from immediate apprehension.
'I suppose, Miss Temple, the thread I bought at Lowton
will do ; it struck me that it would be just of the quality
for the calico chemises, and I sorted the needles to match.
You may tell Miss Smith that I forgot to make a memoran-
dum of the darning needles, but she shall have some papers
sent in next week ; and she is not, on any account, to give
out more than one at a time to each pupil: if they have
more, they are apt to be careless and lose them. And, < > h
ma*am ! I wish the woollen stockings were better looked to I
— when I was here last, I went into the kitchen-garden and
examined the clothes drying on the line; there was a
quantity of black hose in a very bad state of repair : from
the size of the holes in them I was sure they had- not been
well mended from time to time.'
He paused.
'Your directions shall be attended to, sir/ said Miss
Temple.
'And, ma*am,* he continued,'the laundress tells me
some of the girls have two clean tuckers in the week: it is
too much ; the rules limit them to one.'
'I think I can explain that circumstance, sir. Agnes and
Catherine Johnstone were invited to take tea with some
friends at Lowton last Thursday, and I gave them leave to
put on clean tuckers for the occasion.'
Mr. Brocklehurst nodded.
'Well, for once it may pass ; but please not to let the
circumstance occur too often. And there is another thing
which surprised me : I find, in settling accounts with the
housekeeper, that a lunch, consisting of bread and cheese^

)ia3 twice beea served out to the girls during the past
fortaight. How is this ? I looV over the regulaliona, and I
End no such meal as lunch mentioDod. Who inbt)daced
this ianovatioQ? and by what authority?'
'I mu3t be responsible for the circumstance, sir,'replied
Miss Temple :'the breakfast was so iil-prepated that the
pupils could not possibly eat it ; and I dared not allow them
to remain fasting till dinner-time.'
'Madam, allow me an instant. You are aware that my
plan in bringing up these girls is, not to accustom them to
habits of luxury and indulgence, but to render them hardy,
patient, self denying. Should any little accidental disap-
poiulmeut of the appetite occur, such as the spoiling of a
meal, the under or the over dressing of a dish, the incident
ought not to be neutralised by replacing with something
more delicate the comfort lost, thus pampering the body and
obvtatiiig the urn of this instituUoa ; it ought to be improved
to the spiritual edification of the pupils, by encouraging
them to evince fortitude under the temporary privation. A
brief address on those occasions would not be mistimed,
wherein a judicious instnictor would take the opportunity
of referring to the sufferings of the primitive Christians ; to
the torments of martyrs ; to the exhortations of our blessed
Lord himself, calling upoa his disciples to take up their
cross and follow him ; to his warnings that man shall not
live by bread alone, but by every wo^ that proceedeth out
of the mouth of God ; to his divine consolations, " if ye suffer
hunger or thii-st for my sake, happy are ye. " Ob, madam,
when you put bread and cheese, instead of burnt porridge,
into these children's mouths, you may indeed feed their vile
bodies, but yoo little think how you starve their immortal
soolsl'
Mr. BrocUehorst again paused — perhaps overcome by
his feelings. Miss Temple had looked down when he first
began to speak to her ; hut she now gazed straight before
her, and her face, naturally pale as marble, appeared to be
assuming also the coldness and fixity of that material;

especially her mouth, closed as if it would have
sculptor's chisel to open it, and her brow settled gradually
into petrified severity.
Meantime, Mr. Brocklehurst, standing on the hearth with
his hands behind his back, majestically surveyed'the whole
school. Suddenly his eyd gave a bUnk, as if it had mel
something that either dazzled or shocked its pupil ; iuming,
he said in more rapid accents than he had hitherto used ; —
'Miss Temple, Miss Temple, what — what is that giri with
curled hair? Bed hair, ma'am, curled — curled all over?'
And extending his cane he pointed to the awful objeoti bis
hand shaking as he did so.
'It is Julia Severn,'replied IGss Temple, very quietly.
'Julia Severn, ma'am I And why has she, or any other,
curled hair ? Why, in defiance of every precept and prinoi]^
of this house, does she conform to the world so openly —
here in an evangelical, charitable establishment — as to wear
her hair one mass of curls ?'
'Julia's hair curls naturally,'returned Miss Temple, still
more quietly.
'Naturally I Yes, but we are not to conform to nature :
I wish these girls to he the children of Grace : and why thai
abundance ? I have again and again intimated that I desire
the hair to be arranged closely, modestly, plainly. Miss
Temple, that girl's hair must be cut off entirely ; I will send
a barber to-morrow : and I see others who have & ur too
much of the excrescence — that tall girl, tell her to turn round.
Tell all the first form to rise up and direct their faces to the
wall.'
Miss Temple passed her handkerchief over her lips, as if
to smooth away the involuntary smile that curled them ; she
gave the order, however, and when the first class oould take
in what was required of them, they obeyed. T^i^ning %
Uttle back on my bench, I could see the looks and grimaoee
with »which they commented on this manoeuvre : it was a
pity Mr. Brocklehurst oould not see them too ; he would
perhaps have felt that, whateiver he might do with the

outside of the cup and platter, the inside was further beyond
his interference than he imagined.
He scrutinised the reverse of these living medals some
five minutes, then pronounced sentence. These words (eU
like the knell of doom : —'All those top-knots must be out
; off.'
Miss Temple seemed to remonstrate.
'Madam,'be pursued,'I have a master to serve whose
kingdom is not of this world : my mission is to mortify in
these girls the lusts of the flesh ; to teach them to clothe
themselves with shamefaoedness and sobriety, not with
braided hair and costly apparel; and each of the young
persons before us has a string of hair twisted in plaits which
vanity itself might have woven : these, I repeat, must be
cut off; think of the time wasted, of *
Mr. Brocklehurst was here interrupted ; three other
visitors, ladies, now entered the room. They ought to hare
come a little sooner to have beard his lecture on dress, for
they were splendidly attirod in velvet, silk, and furs. The
two younger of the tiio (fine girls of sixteen cuid seventeen)
had grey beaver hats, then in fashion, shaded with ostrich
plumes, and from under the brim of this graceful head-dress
fell a profusion of light tresses, elaborately curled ; the
elder lady was enveloped in a costly velvet shawl, trimmed
with ermine, and she wore a false front of French curls.
These ladies were deferentially received by Miss Temple,
aa Mrs. and the Misses Brocklehut^t, and conducted to seats
of honour at the top of the room. It seems they had come
in the carriage with their reverend relative, and had been
conducting a rummaging scrutiny of the rooms upstairs,
while he transacted business with the housekeeper, questioned
the laundress, and lectured the superintendent. They now
proceeded to address divers remarks and reproofs to Miss
Smith, who was charged with the care of the linen and the
inspection of the dormitories : but I had no time to listen to
what they said ; other matters called off and enchained my
attention.

Hitherto, while gathering up the discourse of Mr.
Brocklehurst and Miss Temple, I had not, at the same time,
neglected precautions to secure my personal safety ; which
I thought would be effected, if I could only elude observa*
tion. To this end, I had sat well back on the form, and
while seeming to be busy with my sum, had held my slate
in such a manner as to conceal my face : I might have
escaped notice, had not my treacherous slate somehow
happened to slip from my hand and falling with an ob-
trusive crash, directly drawn every eye upon me ; I knew il
was all over now, and, as I stooped to pick up the two
fi*agments of slate, I rallied my forces for the worst II
came.
'A careless girl I'said Mr. Brocklehurst, and im-
mediately after —'It is the new pupil, I perceive.'And
before I could draw breath,'I must not forget I have a
word to say respecting her.'Then aloud: how loud it
seemed to me I'Let the child who broke her slate, come
forward I'
Of my own accord, I could not have stirred: I was
paralysed : but the two great girls who sat on each side of
me, set me on my legs and pushed me towards the dread
judge, and then Miss Temple gently assisted me to his very
feet, and I caught her whispered counsel, —'Don'l be
afraid, Jane, I saw it was an accident ; you shall not be
punished.'
The kind whisper went to my heart like a dagger.
'Another minute, and she will despise me for a
hypocrite,'thought I ; and an impulse of fury against
Reed, Brocklehurst, and Co. bounded in my pulses at the
conviction. I was no Helen Bums.
'Fetch that stool,'said Mr. Brocklehurst, pointing to a
very high one from which a monitor had just risen : it was
brought.
'Place the child upon it'
And I was placed there, by whom I don't know : I was
in no condition to note particulars : I was only aware thai

they had hoisted me tip to the height of Mr. Brocklehurst'g
DOse, that he w & s withia a yard of me, and that a spread of
shot oraoge and purple silk pelisses, and a cloud of silveiy
plumage extended and waved below me.
Mr. Brocklehurst hemmed.
'Ladies,'said he, taming to his family ;'Miss Temple,
teachers, and children, yoa all see this girl?'
Of coarse they did; for I felt their eyes directed like
boming-glassea against my scorched skin.
'Tou Bee she is yet young ; you observe she possesses
the ordinary form of childhood ; God has graciously given
her the shape that he has given to all of as ; no signal
deformity points her out as a marked character. Who would
think that the Evil One bad already found a servant and
agent in her ? Yet such, I grieve to say, is the case.'
A pause^in which I began to steady the palsy of my
nerves, and to feel that the Rubicon was passed ; and that
the trial, no longer to shirked, must be firmly sustained.
'My dear children,'pursued the black marble clergyman,
with pathos,'this is a sad, a melancholy occasion ; for it
becomes my duty to warn you, that this girl, who might be
one of God's own lambs, is a little castaway: not a member
of the true flock, but evidently an interloper and an alien.
You must be on your guard against her ; you must shun her
example : if necessary, avoid her company, exclude her from
yonr sports, and shut her out from your converse. Teachers,
yoa mast watch her: keep your eyes on her movements,
weigh well her words, scratinise her actions, punish her
body to save her soul : if, indeed, such salvation he possible,
for (my tongue falters while I tell it) this girl, this child,
the native ot a Christian land, worse than many a little
heathen who says its prayers to Brahma and kneels before
Juggernaut — this girl is — a liar I'
Now came a pause of ten minutes ; daring which I, by
this time in perfect possesion of my wits, observed all the

herself to and fro, and the two younger ones whispered,
* How shocking I'
Mr. Brocklehurst resumed.
* This I learned from her benefactress ; from the pious
and charitable lady who adopted her in her orphan state,
reared her as her own daughter, and whose kindness, whose
generosity the unhappy girl repaid by an ingratitude so bad,
so dreadful, that at last her excellent patroness was obliged
to separate her from her own young ones, fearful lest her
vicious example should contaminate their purity : she has
sent her here to be healed, even as the Jews of old sent their
diseased to the troubled pool of Bethesda; and, teachers,
superintendent, I beg of you not to allow the waters to
stagnate round her.'
With this sublime conclusion, Mr. Brocklehurst adjusted
. the top button of his surtout, muttered something to his
I family, who rose, b6wed to Miss Temple, and then all the
great people sailed in state from the room. Turning at the
I door, my judge said : —'Let her stand half an hour longer
on that stool, and let no one speak to her during the re-
mainder of the day.'
There was I, then, mounted aloft : I, who had said I
could not bear the shame of standing on my natural feet in
the middle of the room, was now exposed to general view
on a pedestal of infamy. What my sensations were, no
language can describe : but just as they all rose, stifling my
breath and constricting my throat, a girl came up and passed
me : in passing, she lifted her eyes. What a strange light
< inspired them ! What an extraordinary sensation that ray
I sent through me I How the new feeling bore me up I It
was as if a martyr, a hero, had passed a slave or victim, and
imparted strength in the transit. I mastered the rising
! hysteria, lifted up my head, and took a firm stand on the
stool. Helen Bums asked some slight question about her
work of Miss Smith, was chidden for the triviality (rf the
I inquiry, returned to her place, and smiled at me as she again
went by. What a smile 1 I i
remember it now, and I know

that it was the eEBuence of fiae intellect;, of true cour & ge ; it
lit up her marked lineaments, her thin face, her sunken grey
eye, like a reflection from the aspect of an augel. Yet at
that moment Helen Bums wore on her arm'the untidy
badge'; scarcely an hour ago I had heard her condemned
by Miss Scatcherd to a dinner of bread and water on the
morrow, because she had blotted an esercioe in copying it
oui. Such is the imperfect nature of man ! such epota are
there on the disc of the clearest planet ; and eyes like Miss
Scatcherd'e can only see those minute defects, and are blind
bo the full brightnesa of the orb.

Ere the half -hour ended, five o'clock simok; school was
dismissed and all were gone into the refectory to tea. I
now ventured to descend : it was deep dusk ; I retired into
a corner and sat down on the floor. The spell by which I
. had been so far supported began to dissolve ; reaction took
J place, and soon, so overwhelming was the grief that seized
I me, I sank prostrate with my face to the ground. Now I
j wept: Helen Bums was not here; nothing sustained me;
I left to myself I abandoned myself, and my tears watered the
I boards. I had meant to be so good, and to do so much at
Lowood : to make so many friends, to earn respect, and win
affection. Already I had made visible progress : that very
morning I had reached the head of my class ; Miss Miller
had praised me warmly ; Miss Temple had smiled approba-
I lion ; she had promised to teach me dravdng, and to lei me
i learn French, if I continued to make similar improvement
^ two months longer: and then I was well-received by my
fellow-pupils ; treated as an equal by those of my own age,
and not molested by any ; now, here I lay agun crushed* and
trodden on ; and could I ever rise more?
'Never,'I thought ; and ardently I wished to die.
While sobbing out this wish in broken accents, some one
I approached : I started up — again Helen Bums was near
me ; the fading fires just showed her coming up the long,
vacant room ; she brought my coffee and bread.
'Come, eat something/ she said ; but I put both away
from me, feeling as if a drop or a crumb would have choked
me in my present condition. Helen regarded me, probably
v^ith surprise : I could not now abate my agitation, though I

the gmund near me, embraced ber knees with ber arms, and
rested ber head upon them ; in that attitude she remdned
nlent as an Indian. I was the first who spoke : —'Helen,
why do yoD stay with & girl whom everybody believes to be
aUar? "
'Everybody, Jane? Why, there are only eighty people
viio have beard yon called so, and tbe world contaias
faondreds of millions.'
'But what have I to do with millioas ? The eighty I
know despise me.'
'Jane, yon are uustaken : probably not one in tbe sobool
either despises or dislikes you : many, I am sore, pity yoa
mooh.'
'How can they pity me after what Mr. Brochlehurst
iT
'Mr. Brocklehurst is not a god : nor is he even a great
and admired man : he is little liked here ; he never took
steps to make himself liked. Had be treated you as an
especial favourite, you would have found enemies, declared
or covert, all around yoa : as it is, tbe greater number would
offer you sympathy if they dared. Teachers and pupUs may
look coldly on you for a day or two, but friendly feelings are
concealed in their hearts; and if yon persevere in doing
well, these feelings will ere long appear eo much the more
evident for their temporary suppression. Be»deB, Jane,'
— — she paoaed.
'Well, Helen ?'s^d I, putting my hand into hers : she
chafed my fingen gently to warm them, and went on : —
'If all the world bated yon, and believed you wicked,
while your own conscience approved you, and absolved yon
from guilt, you would not be without friends.'
'No ; I know I should think weU of myself ; but thai is
not enough : if others don't love me, I would rather die than
live — I cannot bear to be solitary and hated, Helen. Look

to stand behind a kicking horse, and let it dash its hoof at
my chest/
< Hush, Jane I you think too much of the love of honuui
beings, you are too impulsive, too vehement : the soverugn
hand that created your frame, and put life into it, has pro-
nded you vnth other resources than your feeble self, or than
creatures feeble as you. Besides this earth, and besides the
race of men, there is an invisible world and a kingdom of
spirits : that world is round us, for it is everywhere ; and
those spirits watch us, for they are oonmdssioned to guard
us ; and if we were dying in pain and shame, if scorn smote
us on all sides, and hatred crushed us, angels see our tor-
tures, recognise our innocence (if innocent we be : as I know
you are of this charge which Mr. Broddehurst has weakly
and pompously repeated at seoond-hand from Mrs. Beed ;
for I read a sincere nature in your ardent eyes and on your
clear front), and Gk > d waits only the separation of spirit from
flesh to crown us with a full reward. Why, then, should we
ever sink overwhelmed with distress, when life is so soon
over, and death is so certain an entrance to happiness — to
glory ? • A
I was silent : Helen had calmed me ; out in the tran-
quillity she imparted there was an alloy of inexpressible
sadness. I felt the impression of woe as she spoke, bat I
could not tell whence it came ; and when, having done
speaking, she breathed a little fast and coughed a dbori
cough, I momentarily forgot my own sorrows to yield to a
vague concern for hi^.
Besting my head on Helen's shoulder, I put my arms
round her waist; she drew me to her, and we reposed in
silence. We had not sat long thus, when another perscm
came in. Some heavy clouds, swept from the sky by a
rising wind, had left the moon bare ; and her light, stream-
ing in through a window near, shone full both on us and on
the approaching figure, which we at once recognised as Ifiss
Temple.

'I came on purpose to find you, Jane Eyre,'saJd she ;
* I want you in my room ; and as Helen Bums is with you,
she may come too.'
Wa went; following the superintcndent'a guidance, we
had to thread some intricate passages, and mount a stair-
case before we reached her apartment; it contained a
good fire, and looked cheerful. Miss Temple told Helen
Bums to be seated in a low arm-chair on one side of the
hearth, and herself taking another, she called me to her
Sde.
'Is it all over ? " she asked, looking down at my face.
* Have you cried your grief away ?'
'I am afraid I never shall do that.'
•Why?'
'Because I have been wrongly accused; and you, ma'am,
and everybody else will now think me wicked.'
'We shall think you what you prove yourself to be, my
child. Continue to act as a good girl, and you will satisfy
me.'
'Shall I, MisB Temple ?
'You will,'said she, passing her arm round me.'And
now tell me who is the lady whom Mr. Brocklehurst called
your benefaotreR 7'
'Mrs. Beed, my uncle's wife. My uncle is dead, and
left me to her care.'
'Did she not, then, adopt you of her own acoqrd 7'
'Mo, ma'am ; she was sorry to have to do it : but my uncle,
as I have often heard the servants say, got her to promise
before he died, that she would always keep me.'
'Well, now, Jane, you know, or at least I will tell you,
that when a criminal is accused, he is always allowed to
speak in his own defence. Yon have been charged with
falsehood ; defend yourself to me as well as you can. Say
whatever your memory suggests as true ; but add nothing
and exaggerate notliing.'
I resolved, in the depth of my heart, that I would be
most moderate — most correct ; and, having reflected a tew

minutes in order to arrange coherently what I had to say, I
told her all the story of my sad childhood. Exhausted by
emotion, my language was more subdued than it generally
wad when it developed that sad theme; and mindful < ^
Helen's warnings against the indulgence of resentment, I
infused into the narrative far less of gall and wormwood
than ordinary. Thus restrained and simplified, it sounded
more credible : I felt as I went on that Miss Temple folly
believed me.
In the course of the tale I had mentioned Mr. Lloyd as
having come to see me after the fit : for I never forgot the,
to me, frightful episode of the red-room ; in detailing which,
my excitement was sure, in some degree, to break boonde ;
for nothing could soften in my recollection the spasm of
agony which clutched my heart when Mrs. Beed spumed
my wild supplication for pardon, and locked me a second
time in the dark and haunted chamber.
I had finished : Miss Temple regarded me a few minutes
in silence ; she then said : —'I know something of Mr. Lloyd;
I shall write to him ; if his reply agrees with your statement,
you shall be publicly cleared from every imputation : to me,
Jane, you are clear now.'^
She kissed me, and still keeping me at her side (where I
was well contented to stand, for I derived a child's pleasure
from the contemplation of her face, her dress, her one or two
ornaments, her white forehead, her clustered and shining
curls, and beaming dark eyes), she proceeded to address
Helen Bmrns.
'How are you to-night, Helen? Have you coughed
much to-day?'
'Not quite so much, I think, ma'am.'
'And the pain Si your chest?'
< It is a littie better.'
Miss Temple got up, took her hand and exammed her
pulse ; then she returned to her own seat : as she resumed
it, I heard her sigh low. She was pensive a few minutes,
then rousing herself, she said cheerfully : —'But you two are

my visitors to-night ; I must treat you as such.* She rang
herbelL
'Barbara.'she said to the servant who answered it,
'I have no* yet had tea ; bring the tray, and place cups for
these two yonng ladies.'
And a tray was soon brought How pretty, to my eyes,
did the china cups and bright teapot look, placed on the
little round table near the fire I How fragrant was the
steam of the beverage, and the scent of the toast ! of which,
however, I, to my dismay (for I was beginningto ho hungry),
discerned only a very small portion : Miss Temple discerned
it too:—'Barbara,'said she,'can you not bringa little mora
bread and butter? There is not enough for three.'
Barbara went out: she returned soon: —'Madam, Mrs.
'Harden aays she has sent up the usual quantity.'
Mrs. Harden, be it observed, was the housekeeper: a
woman after Mr. Brocklehurst's own heart, made up of equal
parts of whalebone and iron.
'Oh, very well I'returned Miss Temple ;'we must moke
it do, Barbara, I suppose.'And as the girl withdrew, she
added, smiling,'Fortunately, I have it in my power to
supply deficiencies for this onoe.'
Having invited Helen and roe to approach the table, and
placed before each of us a cup of tea with one delicions hut
thin morsel of toast, she got up, unlocked a drawer, and
taking from it a parcel wrapped in paper, disclosed presently
to our eyes a good-sized soed-cake.
'I meant to give each of you some of this to take with
you,'said she ;'but as there is so little toast, you must
have it now,'and she proceeded to out slices with a generous
hand. ^
We feasted that evening as on nectar and ambrosia ; and
not the least delight of the entertainment was the smile of
gratification with which our hostess regarded us, as we
satisfied our famished appetites on the dehcate fare she
liberally suppbed. Tea over and the tray removed, she
again suiDmoned us to the fire ; we sat one on each side of her,

Thus relieved of a grievous load, I from that hour set to
work afresh, resolved to pioneer my way throuj^ every
difficulty : I toiled hard, and my success was proportionate
to my efiforts ; my memory, not naturally tenacious, improved
with practice : exercise sharpened my wits ; in a few weeks
I was promoted to a higher class ; in less than two months
I was allowed to commence French and drawing. I learned
the first two tenses of the verb Etre^ and sketdied my first
cottage (whose walls, by-the-by, outrivalled in slope those of
the leaning tower of Pisa), on the same day. That night,
on going to bed, I forgot to prepare in imagination the
Barmecide supper of hot roast potatoes, or white bread and
new milk, with which I was wont to amnse my inward
cravings : I feasted instead on the spectacle of ideal draw-
ings, which I saw in the dark ; all the work of my own
hands : freely pencilled houses and trees, picturesque rooks
and ruins, Cuyp-like groups of cattle, sweet paintings of
butterflies hovering over unblown roses, of birds picking at
ripe cherries, of wrens'nests enclosing pearl-like eggs,
\\Teathed about with young ivy sprays. I examined, too, in
thought, the possibility of my ever being able to translate
currently a certain little French story-book which Madame
Pierrot had that day shown me; nor was that problem
solved to my satisfaction ere I fell sweetly asleep.''

jmrationa, or rather the handahipa, i
lesaeuod. Spring drew on : she was indeed Already cocoe ;
ibe fiosta of winter had ceased ; its snows were melted, its
cutting ninds ameliorated. My wretched feet, flayed and
swollen to lameness by the sharp air of January, begao to
heal and subside onder the gentler breathings of April ; the
nights and mornings no longer by their Canadian tempera-
tore froze the very blood in our veins ; we could now endon
the play-hour pamed in the garden : aometimes on a sunny
day it began even to be pleasant and genial, and a greenness
grew over those brown beds, which, freshening daily,
suggested the thought that Hope traversed them at night,
and left each morning brighter traces of her steps, flowers
peeped out amongst the leaves ; snowdrops, crocuses, purple
auriculas, and golden-eyed pansies. On Thursday after-
noons (half-hohdays) we now took walks, and found still
sweeter flowen opening by the wayside, under the hedges.
I discovered, too, that a great pleasure, an enjoyment
which the horizon only boundMl, lay all outside the high and
spike-guarded walls of our garden : tiiis pleasure consisted in
prospect of noble summits ^rdling a great hill-hollow, rich
- in verdure and shadow ; in a bright bg^ki full of dark stones
and Bparkhug eddies. How different had this scene looked
when I viewed it \ui out beneath the iron sky of winter,
stiffened in frost,'shrouded with snow I — when mists as
chill as death wandered to the impulse of east winds along
those purple peaks, and rolled down'ing'and holm till they
blended with the frozen fog of the beck I That beck itself
was then a torrent, turUd and curbless : it tore asunder the

wood, and sent a raving sound ihrough ihe ur, often ihiok-
encd with wild rain or whirling sleet ; and for the forest on
its banks, that showed only ranks of skeletona.
April advanced to May : a bright, serene May it was ;
days of blue sky, placid sunshine, and soft western or
southern gales filled up its duration. And now vegetation
matured with vigour; Lowood'shook loose its tresses; it
became all green, all flowery ; its great elm, ash, and oal^
skeletons were restored to majestio life; woodland plants
sprang up profusely in its recesses; unnumbered varieties
of moss filled its hollows, and it made a strange ground*
sunshine out of the wealth of its wild primrose plants : I
have seen their pale gold gleam in overshadowed spots like
scatterings of the sweetest lustre. All this I enjoyed often
and fully, free, unwatched, and almost alone : for this nn*
wonted liberty and pleasure there was a cause, to which it
now becomes my task to advert.
Have I not described a pleasant site for a dwelling, when
I speak of it as bosomed in hill and wood, and rising from
the verge of a stream 7 Assuredly, pleasant enouj^ : but
whether t ^ealthy or not is another question.
Thafforest-dell, where Lowood lay, was the cradle of
fog and fog-bred pestilence; which, quickening with the
quickening spring, crept into the Orphan Asylum, breathed
typhus through its crowded schoolroom and dormitory,
and, ere May arrived, transformed the seminary into a
hospital. .
Semi-starvation and neglected colds had predisposed
most of the pupils to receive infection : forty-five out of the
eighty girls lay ill at one time. Classes were broken up,
rules relaxed. The few who continued well were allowed
almost unlimited licence; because the medical attendant
insisted on the necessity of frequent exercise to keep them
in health: and had it been otherwise, no one had leisure
to watch or restrain them. Miss Temple's whole ^attention
I was absorbed by the patients : she lived in the sick-room,
never quitting it except to snatch a few hours'rest al ni^t

^cre Id bloom ; the borders of the little beds wore gay with
Pmk thrift and crimson double -daisies ; the Bweetbriers gave
Oot, morning and evening, their scent of spice and apples ;
and these fragnnt treasures were all useless for most of the
inmates of Lowood, except to furnish now and thea a hand-
ful of herbs and blossoms to put in a coffin.
But I, and the rest who continued well, enjoyed fully the
beauties of the scene and season : they let us ramble in the
wood, like gipses, from morning till night ; we did what we
liked, went where we liked: we lived better too. Mr.
Brocklehurst and hia family never came near Lowood now :
household matters were not Bcnitinised mto; the cross
housekeeper was gone, driven away by the fear of infection ;
her successor, who bad been matron at the Lowton Dis-
pensary, unused to the ways of her new abode, provided
with comparaUve liberality. Besides, there were fewer to
feed : the sick could eat little ; our breakfast-basins were
better filled : when there was no time to prepare a regular
dinner, which often happened, ebe would give us a large
piece of cold pie, or a thick slice of bread and bheese, and
thii we carried away with us to the wood, where we each
eboae ttte spot we liked best, and dined sumptooutly.

My favourite seat was a smooth and broad stone, rising
white and dry from the very middle of the beck, and only to
be got at by wading through the water ; a feat I aocom*
plished barefoot. The stone was just broad enough to
accommodate, comfortably, another girl and me, at that
time my chosen comrade — one Mary Ann Wilson ; a shrewd*
observant personage, wbose society I took pleasure in, partly
because she was witty and original, and pardy because she
had a manner which set me at my ease. Some years older
than I, she knew more of tbe world, and could tell me many
things I liked to hear : with her my curiosity found graiifl-
cation : to my faults also she gave ample indulgence, never
imposing curb or rein on anything I said. She had a tank
for narrative, I for analysis ; she liked to inform, I to ques-
tion; so we got on swimmingly together, deriving much
entertainment, if not much improvement, from our mutual
intercourse.
And where, meantime, vvas Helen Bums? Why did I
not spend these sweet days of liberty with her? Had I
forgotten her? or was I so worthless as to have grown tired
of her pure society? Surely the Mary Ann Wilson I have
mentioned was inferior to my first acquaintance : she could
only tell me amusing stories, and reciprocate any racy and
pungent gossip I chose to indulge in ; while, if I have spoken
truth of Helen, she was qualified to give those who enjoyed
the privilege of her converse, a taste of far higher things.
True, reader ; ftnd I knew and felt this : and thou^ I
, am a defective being, with many faults and few redeeming
I points, yet I never tired of Helen Bums ; nor ever ceased
i to cherish for her a sentiment of attachment, as strong,
, tender, and .respectful as any that ever animated my heart
j How could it be otherwise, when Helen, at all times and
j under all tcircumstances, evinced for me a quiet and faithful
. friendship, which ill-humour never soured, nor irritation ever
j troubled? ? But Helen was ill at present : for some weeks

portion of the house wiih the (ever patients ; for her com-
plaint was consumption, not typhus : and by consumptioa
I, in my Ignorance, understood something mild, which time
and care would be sure to alleviate.
I was confirmed in this idea by the fact of her once or
twice coming downstairs on very warm sunny afternoons.
and being taken by Miss Temple into the garden : but, on
these occasions, I was not allowed to go and speak to her ;
I only aaw her from the schoolroom window, and then not
distinctly ; (or she was much wrapped up, and sat at a dis-
tance under the verandah.
One evening, in tbe beginning of June, I had stayed out
very late with Mary Ann in the wood ; we bad, as nsual,
separated ourselves from the others, and had wandered far:
BO (ar that we lost our way, and had to ask it at a lonely
cottage, where a man and woman lived, who looked after a
herd of half-wild swine that fed on the mast in the wood.
When we got back, it was after moon-rise : a pony, which
we knew to be the surgeon's, was standing at the garden
door. Mary Ann remarked that she supposed some one
must be very ill, as Mr. Bates had been sent for at that time
of the evening. She 7ent into the house ; I stayed behind >
lew minutes to plant in my garden a handful of roots I had
dug up is the forest, and which I feared would wither if I
left them till the morning. This done, I lingered yeta litl^
longer : the flowers smelt so sweet as the dew fell ; it was
such a pleasant evening, so serene, so warm ; the still glow-
ing west promised so fairly another fine day'on the morrow ;
the moon rose with such majesty in tbe grave east. I wu
noting these things and enjoying them as a child might,
when it entered my mind as it had never done before : —
'How sad to be lying now on a sick bed, a < i^ to be in
danger of dying! This world is pleasant — it would be
dreuy to be called from it, and to have to go wl^o knows
where?'\
And then my mind made its first earnest effort ^ coi "'

and hell : and for the first time it recoiled, baffled ; and (or
the first time glancing behind, on each side, and before it, it
saw all round an mifathomed gulf: it felt the one point
where it stood — the present ; all the rest was formless oloud
and vacant depth : and it shuddered at the thought of totter-
ing, and plunging amid that chaos. While pondering this
new idea, I heard the front door open ; Mr. Bates eaiHe oat,
and with him was a nurse. After she had seen him mount
his horse and depart, she was about to close the door, but I
ran up to her.
< How is Helen Bums 7'
< Very poorly,'was the answer.
* Is it her Inbr. Bates has been to see ?'
'Yes.'
* And what does he say about her?'
'He says she'll not be here long/
This phrase, uttered in my hearing yesterday, would haye
only conveyed the notion that she was about to be removed
to Northumberland, to her own home. I should not have
suspected that it meant she was dying ; but I knew instantly
now: it opened clear on my comprehension that Helen
Bums was numbering her last days in thb world, and that
she was going to be taken to the region of spirits, if such
region there were. I experienced a shock of horror, then a
strong thrill of grief, then a desire — a necessity to see her,
and I asked in what room she lay.
'She is in Miss Temple's room,'said the nurse.
'May I go up and speak to her 7'
'Oh no, child I It is not likely ; and now it is time for
you to come in ; you'll catch the fever if you stop out when
the dew is falling.'
The nurse closed the front door ; I went in by the sida
entrance which led to the schoolroom : I was just in time ;
it was nine o'clock, and Miss Miller was calling the pupils to
go to bed.
It might be two hours later, probably near eleven, when
I— not having been able to fall asleep, and deeming, irom

the perfect silence of the dormitory, that my companions
were all wrapt in profound repose— rose softly, put on my
frock over my night-dress, and, without shoes, crept from the
apartment, and set off in quest of Mies Temple's room. It
was quite at the other end of the house ; but I knew my
way; and the Ught of the imdouded summer moon, entering
here and there at passage windows, enabled me to find it
without difficulty. An odour of camphor and burnt vinegar
warned me when I came near the fever room : and I passed
its door quickly, fearful lest the nurse who sat up all night
should hear me. I dreaded being discovered and sent back ;
for I mtut see Helen, — I must embrace her before she died,
— I must give her one last kiss, exchange with her one
last word.
Having descended a staircase, traversed a portion of the
house below, and succeeded in opening and shutting, without
noise, two doors, I reached another flight of steps ; these I
mounted, and then just opposite to me was Miss Temple's
room. A light shone through the key-hole, and from under
the door ; & profound etillnesB pervaded the vicinity.
Coming near, I found the door slightly ajar; probably to
admit some fresh air into the close abode of sickness.
Indisposed to hesitate, and full of impatient impulses—
soul and senses quivering with keen throes — I put it back
and looked in. My eye sought Helen, and feared to find
death.
Close by Miss Temple's bed, and half covered with its
white curtains, there stood a little crib. I saw the outline ol
a form under the clothes, but the face was hid by the hang-
ings : the nurse I had spoken to in the garden sat in an
easy-chur, asleep ; an onSDnfTed candle burnt dimly on the
table. Miss Temple was not to be seen ; I knew afterwards
that she bad been called to a delirious patient in the fever-
room. I advanced ; then paused by the crib side : my hand
was on the curtun, but I preferred speaking before I with-
drew it I still recoiled at the dread of seeing a corpse.
'Helen I'I whispered softly,'are yon awake ?'

She stirred herself, put back ihe ourtain, and I saw her
face, pale, wasted, but quite composed : she looked so little
changed that my fear was instantly* dissipated.
'Can it be yoOi Jane?'she asked in her own gentle
voice.
'Oh 1'I thought,'she is not going to die : they are
mistaken : she could not speak and look so calmly if she
were.*
I got on to her crib and kissed her : her forehead was
cold, and her cheek both cold and thin, and so were her
hand and wrist ; but she smiled as of old.
'Why are you come here, Jane? It is past eleven
o'clock : I heard it strike some minutes sinoe.'
'I came to see you, Helen : I heard you were very ill, and
I could not sleep till I had spoken to you.'
* You came to bid me good-bye, then : yon are just in time
probably/
'Are you going somewhere, Helen? Are you going
home ?'
'Yes ; to my long home — my last home.'
'No, no, Helen 1'I stopped distressed. While I tried
to devour my tears, a fit of coughing seized Helen ; it did
not, however, wake the nurse ; when it was over, she lay soma
minutes exhausted ; then she whispered : —'Jane, your little
feet are bare ; lie down and cover yourself with my quilt.'
I did so : she put her arm over me, and I needed close to
her. After a long silence, she resumed ; still whispering, —
'I am very happy, Jane ; and when you hear that I am
dead, you must be sure and not grieve : there is nothing to I \
grieve about. We all must die one day, and the illness
which is removing^e is not painful; it is gentle and
gradual : my mind is at rest. I leave no one to regret me
much : I have only a father ; and he is lately married, and
will not miss me. By dying young, I shall escape great suflEar^
ings. I had not qualities or talents to make my way very
well in the world; I should have been continuiJly al

'But wheie an you going to, Helen 7 Can yon see ?
Do you know 7'
'I believe : I have faith : I am going to Qod.'
• Where is God? What is God?'
'My Maker and youra, who will noser destroy what he
created. I rely implicitly on his power, and confide wholly
in his goodness: I count the hours tiW that eventful one
arrives which shall restore me lo him, reveal him to
me.'
'Yon are sure, then, Helen, th & t there is such a place as
heaven ; and that our souls can get to it when we die ?'
'I am sure there is a future state; I believe God is
good ; I can resign my immortal part to him without any
misgiving. God is my father; God is my friend: I love
him : I believe he loves ms.
'Aud shall I see you again, Helen, when I die?'
'You vritl come to the same region of happiness : be
received by the same mighty, univetBal Parent, no douht,
dear Jane.'
Again I questioned; hut this time only in thought
'Where is that region 7 Does it exist ?'And I clasped my
arms closer round Helen ; she seemed dearer to me than
ever ; I felt as if I could not let her go ; I lay with my
face hidden on her neck. Presently she said in the sweetest
tone, —'How comfortable I am I That last fit of coughing
h & a tired me a Uttle ; I feel as if I could sleep : hut don't
leave nie, Jane ; I hke to hare yon near me.'
'I'll stay with yoo, dear Helen : no one shall take me
away.'
'Are you vann, darlingV
•Ybs.'
'Good-night, Jano.*
'Good-night, Helen.'
She kissed me, and I her ; and we both soon sltunbered.
When I awoke it was day: an unusual movement
roused me, I looked up ; I was in somebody's anas ; the
none held me ; she was carrying me through the passage

back to the dormitory. I was not reprimajided for leaving
my bed; people bad something else to think aboni: no.
explanation was afforded then to my many questions; but
a day or two afterwards I learned thai Miss Temjde, on
returning to her own room at dawn, had found me laid in a
little crib ; my face against Helen Bums's shoulder, my
arms round her neck. I was asleep, and Helen was — dead.
Her grave is in Brocklebridge churchyard: for fifteen
years after her death it was only covered by a grassy mound ;
but now a grey marble tablet marks the spot, insoribed with
her name, and the word'Besurgam.'

CHAPTEB X
HiTHEBTO I have recorded in deWl the events of my insignifi-
canl existence : to the first ten years of my life, I have given
almost OB many chapters. But this is not to be a regular auio-
biography : I am only bound to invoke memory where I know
her responses will possess some degi-ee of interest ; therefore
I now pass a space of eight yeai-s almost in silence : a few
lines only are necessary to keep up the links of connection.
When the typhus feVer bad fulfilled its mission of devas-
tation at Lowood, it gradaally disappeared from thence ; but
Dot till its virulence and the number of its victims had
drawn public attention on the school. Inquiry was made
into the origin of the scourge, and by degrees various facts
came ont which excited public indignation in a high degree.
The nnhealthy nature of the site ; the quantity and quality of
the children's food ; the brackish, fetid water used in its
preparation ; the pupils'wretched clothing and accommoda-
tion : all these things were discovered ; and the discovery
produced a result mortifying to Mr. BrocMehurst, but
beneficial to the institution.
Several wealthy and benevolent individuals in the
coxmty subscribed largely for the erection of a mora con-
venient building in a better situation ; new regulations were
made ; improvements in diet and clothing introduced ; the
funds of tii & school were entrusted to the management of a
committee. Mr. Brocklehurst, who, from his wealth and
family connections, could not be overlooked, still retained
the post of treasurer ; but he was aided in the discharge of
his duUes by gentlemen of rather more enlarged and sym-
pathising minds : his office of inspector, too, was shared by

those who knew how to combine reason wiih strietneM,
comfort with economy, compassion with uprightneas.
The school, thus improved, became in time a truly useful
and noble institution. I remained an inmate of its walls,
after its regeneration, for eight years : six as pupil, and two
as teacher ; and in both capacities I bear my testimony to
its value and importance.
During these eight years my life was uniform : but not
uuhappy, because it was not inactive. I had the means of an
excellent education placed within my reach. A fondness for
some of my studies, and a desire to excel in all, together
with a great delight in pleasing my teachers, especially such
as I loved, urged me on : I availed myself fully of the advan-
tages offered me. In time I iX > se to be the first girl of the
first class ; then I was invested with the office of teacher ;
which I discharged with zeal for two years ; but at the end
of that time I altered.
Miss Temple, through all chan^, had thus far continued
supenntendent of the seminary: to her instruction I owed
the best part of my acquirements ; her friendship and society
had been my continual solace : she had stood me in the stead
of mother, governess, and, latterly, companion. At this period
she married, removed with her husband (a clergyman, an
excellent man, almost worthy of such a wife) to a distant
county, and consequently was lost to me.
From the day she left I was no longer the same : with
her was gone every settled feeling, every association thai
had made Lowood in some degree a home to me.'I had
imbibed from her something of her nature and much of her
habits: more harmonious thoughts: what seemed better*
regulated feelings had become the inmates of my mind. I
had given in allegiance to duty and order ; I was quiet ; I
believed I was content : to the eyes of others, usually even to
my own, I appeared a disciplined and subdued character.
But destiny, in the shape of the Rev. Mr. Nasmyth, came
between me and Miss Temple : I saw her in her travelling
dress step into a post-chaise, shortly after the marriage

Gateshead ; neither she nor any of her tsmlj had ever been
to visit me. I had had no communication by letter or
message with the outer world: school-rules, school-duiieSp
school-habits and notions, and voices, and£ftces, and phrases,
and costumes, and preferences, and antipathies : such was
what I knew of existence. And now I fdt that it was not
enough : I tired of the routine of eight years in one after-
noon. I desired liberty ; for liberty I gasped; for liberty I
uttered a prayer ; it seemed scattered on the wind then
faintly blowing. I abandoned it and framed a humbler
supplication; for change, stimulus: that petition, too,
seemed swept off into vague space :'Then,'I cried, half
desperate,'grant me at least a new servitude 1'
Here a bell, ringing the hour of supper, called me dovni-
stairs.
I was not free to resume the interrupted chain of my
reflections till bedtime : even then a teacher who occupied
the same room with me kept me from the subject to which
I longed to recur, by a prolonged effuaon of smaU talk*
How I wished sleep would silence her I It seemed as if,
could I but go back to the idea which had last entered my
mind as I stood at the window, some inventive suggestion
would rise for my relief.
Miss Gryce snored at last; she was a heavy Welsh- ^\
woman, and till now her habitual nasal strains had never
been regarded by me in any other light than as a nuisance ;
to-night I hailed the first deep notes with satisfaction ; I
was debarrassed of interruption ; my half-efiiEused thought t
instancy revived. ^ "
'A new servitude I There is something in that,* I
soliloquised (mentally, be it understood; I did not talk
aloud).'I know there is, because it does not sound too
sweet; it is not like such words as Liberty, Excitement,
Enjoyment : delightful sounds truly ; but no more than
sounds for me ; and so hollow and fleeting that it is mere
waste of time to listen to them. But Servitude I That .
must be matter of fact Any one may serve: I have

served here eight years ; now all I want ia to serve else-
where. Can I not get so much of my own will ? Is not
the thing feasible? Yes — yea — the end is not so difficult;
if I had only a brain active enough to ferret oat the means
of attaining it'
I sat up in bed by way of arousing this said brain : it
was a chiUy night ; I eovered my shoulders with a shawl,
and then t proceeded to think again with all my might.
'What do I want? A new place, in a new house,
amongst new faces, under new ciroomstances : I want this
becanse it is o( no use wanting anything better. How do
people do to get a new place ? They apply to friends, I
suppose : I have no friends. There are many others who
have no friends, who must look about for themselves and be
their own helpers ; and what is tbeJr resource ?'
I could not tell : nothing answered me ; I then ordered
my brun to find a response, and qoickly. It worked and
worked faster : I (elt the pulses throb in my head and
lemplea ; but for nearly an hour it worked in chaos, and no
result came of its efforts. Feverish with vain labour, I
got np and took a turn in the room ; nndrew the curtain,
noted a star or two, shivered with cold, and again crept
tobed.
A kind fairy, in my absence, bad surely dropped the
requited suggestion on my pillow ; for as I lay down it came
quietly and naturally to my mind : —'Those who want
wtuations advertise ; you most advertdse in the skire
Beraid:
'How? I know nothing abont advertising.'
Beplies rose smooth and prompt now : —'You must
inclose the advertisement and the money to pay for it under
a'cover directed to the Editor of the Serald ; you must put
it, the first opportunity you have, into the post at Lowton ;
answers must be addressed to J. E. at the post-office there :
you can go and inquire in about a week aft«r you send your
letter, if any are come, and act accordingly.'
This scheme I went over twice, thrice ; it was then

■ • " - • " - -*— - ir " • " — " -- —l-f-Miir'r'^t^'ttf-^*'^*'^
JANE EYBB 101
digested in my mind : I had it in a dear practical form ; I
felt satisfied, and fell asleep.
With earliest day I was up : I had my advertisement
written, inclosed^ and directed before the bell rang to roiue
the school : it ran thus : —
'A young lady accostomed to tuition'(had I not been a
teacher two years ?)'is desirous of meeting with a dtuation
in a private family where the children are under fourteen *
(I thought that as I was barely eighteen, it would not do to
undertake the guidance of pupils nearer my own age).'She
is qualified to teach the usual branches of a good " Rngliiib
education, together with French, Drawing, and Mudc'Qn
those days, reader, this now narrow catalogue of aocon^plidi.
ments would have been held tolerably comprehensiYe).
* Address, J. E., Post-ofiBce, Lowton, shire.'
This document remained locked in my drawer all day :
after tea, I asked leave of the new superintendent to go
to Lowton, in order to perform some small commissions for
myself and one or two of my fallow-teachers ; permissioii
was readily granted : I went It was a walk of two miles,
and the evening was wet, but the days were still long ; I
visited a shop or two, slipped the letter into the post-office,
and came back through heavy rain, with streaming garments,
but with a relieved heart.
The succeeding week seemed long : it came to an end
at last, however, like all sublunary things, and once more,-
towards the close of a pleasant autumn day, I found myself
afoot on the road to Lowton. A picturesque track it was, by
the way» lying along the side of the bock and through the
sweetest curves of the dale : but that day I thought more
of the letters, that might or might not be awaiting me at the
little burgh whither I was bound, than of the charms of lea
and water.
My ostensible errand on this occasion was to get measured
for a pair of shoes ; so I discharged that business first, and
when it was done, I stepped across the clean and quiet little
street from the shoemaker's to the post-office; it was kept

This circumstance was satisfactory: a private fear hacl
haunted me that, in than acting for myself, and by my own*
guidance, I ran the risk of getting into some scrape! %ttf| ^
above all things, I wiuliod the result of my endeavours to be
respectable, proper, en n\gU, I now felt that an elderly lady
was no bad ingredient in the business I had on hand. Mrs.
Fairfax I I saw her in a black gown and widow's oap,—
frigid, perhaps, but not unci il : a model of elderly English
respectability. Thomfield ! tl at, doubtless, was the name of
her house— a neat, orderly epot, I ^Yas sure, though I failed
in my efifoiis to conceive a coi ^ct plan of the premises.
MiUcote, shire. I brushed \.i my recollections of the
map of England ; yes, I saw > ^, both *ie shire and the town.
shire was seventy miles nearer Loi^on than the remo% &
county where I now resided ; that was a recommendation to
me. I longed to go where there was life i*^ movement.
Millcote was a large manufacturing town on the baJrn of the
A : a busy place, enough, ^doubtless : so much thebe^««r;
it would be a complete change atieast. Not that my fanoy
was much captivated by the idea of l < xig chimneys and
clouds of smoke—'but,'I argued,'Thomfield will, probably,
be a good way from the town.'
Here the socket of the candle dropped, and the wibk went
out
Next day new steps were to be taken ; my plans oould
no longer be confined to my own breast ; I must impart them
m order to achieve their success. Having sought and
obtained an audience of the superintendent during the noon-
tide recreation, I told her I had a prospect of getting a new
situation where the salary would be double what I now
received (for at Lowood I only got fifteen pounds per
annum), and requested she would break the matter for me to
Mr. Brocklehurst, or some of the committee, and ascertain'
whether they would permit me to mention them as referenoea.
She obligingly consented to act as mediatrix in the matter.
The next day she laid the afibir before Mr. Brocklehurst,
who said that Mrs. Seed must be written to, as she was my


I
natural guardian. A note was acoorilingly addressed to that
lady, who returned for answor, that'I might do as I pleased :
she had long relinquished all interference in my affairs. "
This note went the round o! the committee, and, at last, after
what appeared to me most tedious delay, formal leave was
riven me to better my condition if I could ; and an assui-ance
added that, as I had always conducted myself well, both as
teacher and pupil, at Lowood, r testimonial of character and
capacity, signed by the inspe < vor8 of that institution, should
forthwith be furnished me.
This testimonial I accr-dingly received in about a month,
forwarded a copy of it'J Mrs. Fairfax, and got that lady's
reply, stating that 8^^J was satisfied, and fixing that day
.V. tiUgLt an the per^ for my assuming the post of governess
in her house.
I now b <'< - < ^ myself in preparationa : the fortnight passed
rapidiv ^ had not a very large wardrobei though it was
^/C^oate to my wants ; and the last day sufficed to pack
my tnink,— the same I had brought with rae eight years ago
from Gateshead.
The box was corded, the card nailed on. In half an horn
the carrier was to call for it to take it to Lowton, whither I
myself was to repair at an early hour the next morning to
meet the coadi. I had brushed my black staff travelling
dress, prepared my bonnet, gloves, and muff ; sought in all
my drawers to see that no article was left behind ; and now,
having nothing more to do, I sat down and tried to rest. I
could not, though I had been on foot all day — I could not
now repose an instant — I was too much excited. A phase of
my life was downg to-night, a new one opening to-morrow :
impossible to slumber in the interval ; I must watch
feverishly while the change was being accomplished.
'Miss,'said a servant who met me in the lobby, where I
was wandering like a troubled spirit,'a person below wishes
to see yon.'
'The carrier, no doubt, " I thought, and ran downstairs
withoat inqoiry. I was passing the back parlour, or teachers'

sitting-room, the door of which was half-open, to go io the
kitchen, when someone ran out.
'It's her, I am sure 1 — I could have told her anywhere !'
cried the individual who stopped my progress and took my
hand.
I looked. I saw a woman attired like a well-dressed
servant, matronly, yet still young ; very good-looking, with
black hair and eyes, and livdy complexion.
'Well, who is it?'she asked, in a voice and with a smile
I half recognised I'You've not quite forgotten me, I think.
Miss Jane ?'
In another second I was embracing and kissing her
rapturously.'Bessie I Bessie I Bessie I'that was all I
said; whereat she half laughed, half cried, and we both
went into the parlour. By the fire stood a little fellow- of
three years old, in plaid frock and trousers.
'That is my little boy,'^d Bessie, directly.
< Then you are married, Bessie?*
'Yes : nearly five years since, to Bobert Leaven, the \
coachman, and I've a Uttle girl besides Bobby there that Fve * <
christened Jane.*
'And you don't live at Gateshead?'
'I live at the lodge : the old porter has left*
'Well, and how do they all get on ? Tell me everything
about them, Bessie : but sit down first ; and, Bobby, oome
and sit on my knee, will you ?'But Bobby preferred sidling
over to his mother.
'You're not grown so very tall, ]£ss Jane, nor so very
stout/ continued Mrs. Leaven.'I dare say they've not kept
you too well at school : Miss Beed is the head and shouldm
taller than you are ; and Miss Georgiana would make two of
you in breadth.*
'Georgiana is handsome, I suppose, Bessie? *
'Very. She went up to London last winter with her
mamma, and there everybody admired her, and a young lord
fell in love with her: but his relations were against the
match ; and — what do you think ? — ^he and Miss Georgia a
lOS JANE ETBB ^M
Eoade it up to ran away : but they were found out and
stopped. It was Miss Beed that found them out : I believe
she was envious ; aud now she and her sister lead a cat and
dog iife together ; they are always quarrelling.'
'Well, and what of John Keed ?'
'Oh, he ia not doing so well as bis mamma could wish.
He went to college, and he got — plucked, I think they call
it: and then bis uncles wanted bim to be a barrister, and
study the law : but be is such a dissipated young moo, they
will never make muoh of him, t tbink.'
'What does he look hke 7'
'He is very tall : some people call bim a fine-looking
young man ; but be bas such thtok lips.'
■ And Mrs. Beed ?'
'Missis looks stout and well enougb in the face, but I
think she's not quite easy in her mind : Mr. John's conduct
does not please ber — he spends a deal of money.'
'Did she send you here, Besde 7'
'No, indeed : but I have long wanted to see you, and
when I heard that there had been a letter ti'om you, and that
you were going to another part of the country, I thought I'd
just set oET, and get a look at you before you were quite out
of my reach.'
'I am afraid you are disappointed in me, Bessie.'I
said this laughing : I perceived that Bessie's glance, though
it expressed regard, did in no shape denote admiration.
'No, Miss Jane, not exaotly : you are genteel enougb ;
you look like a lady, and it is as muoh as ever I expected of
you : you were do beauty as a child.'
I smiled at Bessie's frank answer: I felt that it was
correct, but I confess I was not quite indifferent to its import :
at eighteen most people wish to please, and the conviction
that they have not an exterior likely to second that desire
brings anything bat gratificaUon.
'I dare say you are clever, though,'continued Bessie, by
way of solaoe.'What can you do ? Can you play on the
piano?'

There was one in lihe room ; Bessie went and opened ik»
and then asked me to sit down and give her a tone : I
played a waltz or two, and she was charmed.

It was a landscape in water colours, of which I had miebde a
present to the superintendent, in acknowledgment of her
obliging mediation with the committee on my behalf, and
which she had framed and glazed.
'Well, that is beautiful. Miss Janel It is as fine a

CHAPTEB XI
A NEW chapter in a novel is something like a new scene in
a play : and when I draw up the curtain this time, reader,
you must fancy you see a room in the'George Inn'al
Millcote, with such large figured papering on the walls as
inn rooms have ; such a carpet, such furniture, such orna-
ments on the mantelpiece, such prints ; including a portrait
of George the Third, and another of the Prince of Wales,

cotmcction, nncertam whether the port to which it ia bound
can be reached, and prevented by many impediments from
returning to that it has quitted. The charm of adventure
sweetens that Bensation, the glow of pride warma it ; but
then the throb of fear disturbs it ; and fear with me became
predominant, when half aa hour elapsed and still I was
alone. I bethought myself to ring the bell.
'Is there a place in this neighbourhood called Thorn-
field?'r asked of the waiter who answered the summons.
'Thomfield? I don't know, ma'am ; I'll inquire at the
bar.'He vanished, but reappeared instantly : —'Is your
name Eyre, Miss ?'
•Yes.'
■ Person here waiting for yon,'
I jumped up, took my muff and umbrella, and hastened
into the inn-passage : a man was standing by the open
door, and in the lamp-lit street I dimly saw a one-horse
conveyance.
'liiis will be your luggage, I suppose 7'said the man
rather abruptly when he saw me, pointing to my trunk in the
passage.
'Yes.'He hoisted it on to the vehicle, which was a sort
of car, and then I got in : before he shut me up I asked him
how tar it waa to Thomfield.
'A matter of six miles.'
'How long shall we be before we get there 7'
'Happen an hoar and a half.'
He fastened the car door, climbed to his own seat out-
nde, and we set off. Our progress was leisurely, and gave me
ample time to reflect ; I was content to be at length so near
the end of my journey; and as I leaned back in the com-
fortable though not elegant conveyance, I meditated much
at my ease.
'I suppose,'thought I,'judging from the plainness of the
servant and carriage, Mrs. E^irfai is not a very dashing
person: bo much the better; I never lived amongst fine
people but once, and I was very miserable with them. I

wonder if she lives alone except this litUe girl ; if so, and if
she is in any degree amiahle, I shall surely be able to get on
with her 1 I will do my best : it is a pity that doing one's
best does not always answer. At Lowood, indeed, I took
that resolution, kept it, and succeeded in pleasing ; but with
Mrs. Beed, I remember, my best was always spumed with
scorn. I pray God Mrs. Fairfax may not turn out a seoond
Mi's. Beed ; but if she does, I am not bound to stay with
her : let the worst come to the worst, I can advertise again.
How far are we on our road now, I wonder?'
I let down the window and looked out: Milloote was
behind us ; judging by the number of its lights, it seemed
a place of considerable magnitude, much larger than Lowton.
We were now, as far as I could see, on a sort of common ;
but there were houses scattered all over the district; I felt
we were in a different re^on to Lowood, more populous, less
picturesque ; more stirriitg, less romantic.
The roads were heavy, the night misty ; my conductor
let his horse walk all the way, and the hour and a half ex-
tended, I verily believe, to two hours; at last he turned
in his seat and said:'You're noan so far fro'Thomfield
now.'
Again I looked out : we were passing a church : I saw
its low broad tower against the sky, and its bell was tolling
a quarter ; I saw a narrow galaxy of lights too, on a hill-
side, marking a village or hamlet. About ten minutes after
the driver got down and opened a pair of gates ; we passed
through, and they clashed to behind us. We now slowly
ascended a drive, and came upon the long front of a house :
candle-light gleamed from one curtained bow-window ; all
the rest were dark. The car stopped at the front door ; it
was opened by a maidservant ; I alighted and went in.
'Will you walk this way, ma'am,'said the girl ; and I
followed her across a square hall with high doors all round :
she ushered me into a room whose double illumination of
fire and candle at first dazzled me, contrasting as it did with
the darkness to which my eyes had been for two hours

inared ; when I could see, however, a cozy and agreeable
picture presented itself to my view.
A BDtig, small room ; & round table by a cheerful fire ;
an armchair high-backed and old-fashioned, wherein sat the
neatest imaginable little elderly lady, in widow's cap, black
sillc gown, and snowy muslin apron : exactly like what I had
fancied Mrs. Fairfax, only less stately and milder-looking.
6he was occupied in knitting ; a large cat sat demurely at
her feet ; nothing in short was wanting to complete the
bean ideal of domestic comfort. A more reassuring intro-
duction for a new governess could scarcely be conceived:
there was no grandeur to overwhelm, no stateliness to
embarrass ; and then, as I entered, the old lady got up, and
promptly and kindly came forward to meet me.
'How do you do, my dear? I am afraid you have had
ft tedioas ride; John drives so slowly: you must be cold;
oome to the Sre.'
'Mrs, Fairfax, I suppose? " said I.
'Yes, you are right : do sit down.'
She conducted me to her own chair, and then began to
remove my shawl and untie my bonnet-strings. I begged
she would not give herself bo much trouble.
'Oh, it is no trouble ; I dare eay your own hands are
almost numbed with cold. Leah, make a little hot negus
and cot a sandwich or two : here are the keys of the store-
room.'
And she produced from her pocket a most housewifely
bunch of keys, and delivered them to the servant.
'Now, tiien, draw nearer to the fire,'she oonitnued.
'You've brought your luggage with yon, haven't you, my dear ?'
'Yes, ma'am.'
'I'll see it carried into your room,'she said, and bustled
onb
'She treats me like a visitor,'thought I.'I little
expected such a reception ; I antidpated only ooldness and
stiffness : this is not like what I have heard of the treaU
ment of govemesaes ; but I must not exult too soon.'

She returned, with her own hands cleared her
apparatus and a book or two from the table, to make room
for the tray which Leah now brought, and then herself
handed me the refreshments. I felt rather confused at
bclDg the object of more attention than I had ever before
received, and that, too, shown by my employer and superior;
but as she did not herself seem to consider she was ddng
anything out of her place, I thought it better to take her
civilities quietly.
'Shall I have the pleasure of seeing Miss Fairfax to- •
night ?'I asked, when I had partaken of what she ofiEsred j
me.
'What did you say, my dear? I am a liitle deaf»*
returned the good lady, approaching her ear to my mouth.
I repeated the question more distinctly.
'Miss Fairfax ? Oh, you mean Miss Varens 1 Vazens it \
the name of your future pupiL*
'Indeed I Then she is not your daughter ? ^
'No, — I have no family.*
I should have followed up my first inquiry by asking
in what way Miss Varens was connected with her; but I
recollected it was not polite to ask too many questions:
besides, I was sure to hear in time.
'I am so glad,'she continued, as she sat down opposite to
me, and took the cat on her knee ;'I am so glad you are oome ;
it will be quite pleasant living here now with a companion.
To be sure it is pleasant at any time ; for Thomfield is a
fine old hall, rather neglected of late years perhaps, but still
it is a respectable place ; yet you know in winter time one
feels dreary quite alone, in the best quarters. I say alone —
Leah is a nice girl to be sure, and John and his wife are very
decent people ; but then you see they are only servants, and
one can't converse with them on terms of equality : one must
keep them at due distcuice, for fear of losing one's authority.
I'm sure last winter (it was a very severe one, if you recollect^
and when it did not snow, it rained and blew) not a crea-
ture but the butcher and postman came to the house from

Norember till February ; and I really got quite melancholy
with sitting night after night alone. I had Leah in to read to
me sometimes ; but I don't think the poor girl liked the
task much: she felt it coofining. Id spring and Bummer
one got on better : sunshine and long days make such &
diSerence; and then, just at the commencement of this
autumn, little Adela Varena came and her nurse : a child
makes a house alive all at once; and now you are here
I shall be quite gay.'
My heart really warmed to the worthy lady as I heard
her talk : and I drew my chair a little nearer to her, and
expressed my sincere wish that she might find my company
as agreeable as she anticipated.
'Bnt I'll not keep you sitting up late to-night,'said
she ;'it is on the stroke of twelve now, and you have been
travelling all day : you must feel tired. If you have got your
feet well wanned I'U show yoa your bedroom. I've had
the room next to mine prepared for you ; it is only a small
apartment, but I thought you would like it better than one
of the large front chambers : to be sure they have finer fur-
niture, bnt they are so dreary and solitary, I never sleep in
them myself.*
I thanked her for her considerate choice, and as I really
felt fatigued with my long journey, expressed my readiness
to retire. She took her candle, and I followed her from the
room, first she went to see if the hall-door was fastened ;
having taken the key from the lock, she led the way upstairs.
The steps and banisters were of oak; the staircase window
vras high and latticed ; both it and the long gallery into
which the bedroom doors opened looked as if they belonged
to a ohurch rather than a house. A very chill and vaultlike
air pervaded tbe stairs and gallery, suggesting cheerless
ideas of space and solitude ; and I was glad when finally
ushered into my chamber to find it of small dimenuons,
and furnished in ordinary modem styl^
When Mrs. Fairfax had bidden me a kind good-ni^t, and
I had fastened my door, gazed leisurely roond, and in some

measure e & ced the eerie impression made by that \ride hall,
that dark and spacious staircase, and that long, cold gallery,
by the livelier aspect of my little room, I remembered that
after a day of bodily fatigue and mental anxiety I was now
at last in safe haven. The impulse of gratitude swelled my
heart, and I knelt down at the bedside, and offered up thanks
where thanks were due ; not forgetting, ere I rose, to implore
aid on my further path, and the power of meriting the kind-
ness which seemed so frankly offered me before it was
earned. My couch had no thorns in it that night ; my solitary
room no fears. At once weary and content, I slept soon
and soundly : when I awoke it was broad day.
The chamber looked such a bright little place to me as
the sun shone in between the gay blue chintz window curtains,
showing papered walls and a carpeted floor, so unlike the
bare planks and stainod plaster of Lowood that my spirits
rose at the view. Externals have a great effect on the
young : I thought that a fairer era of life was beginning for
me, one that was to have its flowers and pleasures, as well
as its thorns and toils. My faculties, roused by the change
of scene, the new field offered to hope, seemed all astir.
I cannot precisely define what they expected, but it was
something pleasant : not perhaps that day or that month,
but at an indefinite future period.
I rose ; I dressed myself with care : obliged to be plain
—for I had no article of attire that was not made with
extreme simplicity— I was still by nature solicitous to be
neat It was not my habit to be disregardful of appearance,
or careless of the impression I made: on the contrary, I
ever wished to look as well as I could, and to please as
much as my want of beauty would permit. I sometimes
regretted that I was not handsomer : I sometimes wished
to have rosy cheeks, a straight nose, and small cherry
mouth ; I desired to be tall, stately, and finely developed in
figure ; I felt it a misfortune that I was so little, so pale,
and had features so irregular and so marked. And why
had I these aspirations and these regrets? It would be

recoQ from me with antipathy. Hariogt^ieoed my chamfaet
window, and seen that I left all things straight and neat on
the VoiHet table, I Tentared forth.
Traversing the long and matted gallety, I desceoded the
slippery steps o( oak ; then I gain^ the ball : I halted there
a minute : I looked at some pictures oa the walls (one I
remember represented a grim man in a eniraaa, and one
a lady with powdered hair and a pead oeeklaoe), at a brocue
lamp pendent bom the cei & ng, at a great clock wboae cue
waa of oak eurioasly carred. and ebon bUck with time and

to me : but then I was so little aocnstomed to grandeor. The
hall-door, wbicb waa half of glass, stood open ; I stepped
over the thresbi^ It was a fine aotomn morning; the

to find existent so near the stirring locality of liSIIcote. A
little hamlet whose roofs were blent with trees straggled op
the side of one of these hills ; the church of the district stood
nearer Thomfield: its old tower-top looked over a knoll
between the house and gates,
I was yet enjoying the calm prospect and pleasant fireah
air, yet listening with delight to the cawing of the rooks, yet
surveying the wide, hoary front of the hall, and thinking
what a great place it was for one lonely little dame like
Mrs. Fairfax to inhabit, when that lady appeared at the
door.
'What I out already ?'said she. * I see yon are an early
riser.'I went up to her, and was received with an aflEable
kiss and shake of the hand.
'How do you like Thomfield?'she asked. I told her I
liked it very much.
'Tes/ ^e said,'it is a pretty place : but I fear it will be
getting out of order, unless Mr. Bochester should take it into }
his head to come and reside here permanently ; or, at leaat, ^
visit it rather oftener : great houses and fine grounds require
the presence of the proprietor.*
'Mr. Bochester I'I exclaimed. * Who is he? *
'The owner of Thomfield,'she responded quietly. * Did
you not know he was called Bochester?'
Of course I did not — I had never heard of him before ;
but the old lady seemed to regard his existence aa m
universally imderstood fact, vrith which everybody must be
acquainted by instinct.
'I thought,'I continued,'Thomfield belonged to yon.'^
'To me ? Bless you, child ; what an idea I To me? I
am only the housekeeper — the manager. To be sure I am
distantly related to the Bochesters by the mother's side ; or, •
at least, my husband was : he was a clergyman, incumbent
of Hay — that little village yonder on the hill— and thai
church near the gat^s was his. The present Mr. Boohester^s
mother was a Fairfax, and second cousin to my husband;
but I never presume on the connection— in fact it it nothing
I
118 JANE EYBE
to IDS ; I consider myself quite in tlie light of & n ordinary
hooaekeeper: my employer is always civil, and I espect
nothing more.'
■ And the little girl— my pupil ?'
.'She is Mr. Bocbestar's ward ; be commissioned me to find
a governess for ber. He intends to bave ber brought up in
ahire, I believe. Here she comes with her " bonne, " as
she calls ber narse. The enigma then was explained : this
affable and kind little- widow was no great dame, bat a
dependent like myself. I did not lilce ber the worse for
that; on the contrsjry, I felt better pleased tban ever. The
equality between her and me was real ; not the mere result
of condescension on her part : bo much the better — my
position was all the freer.
As I was meditating on this disoovery, a little ^1,
followed by her attendant, came ranning up the lawn. I
looked at my pupil, who did not at first appear to notice roe :
she was quite a child, perhaps seven or eight years old,
slightly built, with a pale, small-featucd face, and a re-
dundancy of bair falling in curls to her wusL
'Good-moming, Uiss Adela,'said Mrs. Fairfax.'Come
and Hpeak to the lady who is to teach yoo, and to make yon
a clever woman some day.'She approached.
'C'est \k ma gouvemante 7'said she, pointing to me, and
addressing her nurse ; who answered :'Mais ooi, oertaine-
ment'
'Are they foreigners ?'I inquired, amazed at bearing
the Fl-ench langoage.
'The nurse is a foreigner, and Adela was bom on the
Continent, and, I believe, never left it till within ax months
ago. When she 6rst came here she oould speak no English ;
now she can make shift to talk it a little : I don't under-
stand her, she mixes it so with PVencb ; but yon will make
out ber meaning very well, I daresay.'
Fortunately I had bad the advantage of being taught
French by a French lady; and as I had always made a

I could, and had, beaides, during the last seven years^ learnt
] a portion of French by heart didly — applying myself to take
j pains with my accent, and imitating as closely as possible the
1 pronunciation of my teacher — I had acquired a certain degree
: of readiness and correctness in the language, and was not
; likely to be much at a loss with Mademoiselle Adela. She
j came and shook hands with me when she heard that I was
j her governess ; and as I led her into breakfast I addressed
some phrases to her in her own tongue : she replied briefly
at first, but after we were seated at the table, and she had
examined me some ten minutes with her large hazel eyes,
she suddenly commenced chattering fluently.
< Ah 1'cried she, in French,'you speak my language as
well as Mr. Bochester does : I can talk to you as I can to
him, and so can Sophie. She will be glad : nobody here
understands her : Mada,pie Fairfax is all English. Sophie is
my nurse ; she came with me over the sea in a great ship
with a chimney that smoked — how it did smoke i — and I
was sick, and so was Sophie, and so was Mr. Bochester.
I Mr. Bochester lay down on a sofa in a pretty room called
j the salon, and Sophie and I had little beds in another place.
i , I nearly fell out of mine ; it was like a shelf. And Made*
moiselle what is your name ?'
* Eyre — Jane Eyre/
'Aire ? Bah i I cannot say it Well : our ship stopped
in the morning, before it was quite daylight, at a great city
I —a huge city, with very dark houses and all smoky ; not at
j all like the pretty clean town I came from ; and Mr. Bochester
j earned me in his arms over a plank to the land, and Sophie
] came after, and we all got into a coach, which took us to a
} beautiful large house, larger than this and finer, called an
j hotel. We stayed there nearly a week. I and Sophie used
I to walk every day in a great green place fuU of trcM, called
I the Park ; and there were many children there besides me, and
j a pond with beautiful birds in it, that I fed with crumbs.*
'Can you understand her when she runs on so fast
asked Mrs. Fairfax.
I
120 JANE EYBE
I understood her very well, tor I bad been accastoined to
the fluent tongue of Madame Pierrot.
'I wish,'continued the good lady,'you would ask her
a question or two about her parents : I wonder if she
remembera them ?'
'Adiile,'I inquired,'with whom did you live when yon
were in that pretty clean town you spoke of ?'
'I lived long ago with mamma ; hut she is gone to the
Holy Virgin. Mamma used to teach me to dance and siag,
and to say verses. A great many gentlemen and ladies
came to see mamma, and I used to dance before them, or to
sic on their knees and sing to them : I liked it. Shall I let
you hear me sing now 7'
She bad Qnisbed her breakfast, so 1 permitted her to give
a spedmeu of her accomplishments. Descending from her
chair, she c & me and placed herself on my knee ; then, folding
her little hands demurely before her, shaking back her curls
and lifting her eyes io the ceiling, she commenced singing a
aong from some Opera. It was the strain of a forsaken lady,
who, after bewailing the perfidy of her lover, calls pride to
her aid ; desires her attendant to deck her in her brightest
jewels and richest robes, and resolves to meet the false one
that night at a ball, and prove to him, by the gaiety of hei
demeaaoor, how little his desertion has aSected her.
The subject seemed strangely ohosen for an infant singer ;
but I sttppose the point of the exhibition lay in hearing the
notes of love and jealousy warbled with the lisp of child-
hood ; and in very bad taste that point was : at least I
thought to.
Adile sang the canzonette tunefully enough, and with
the naivete of her age. This achieved, she jumped from
my knee and said,'Now, Mademoiselle, I will repeat you
some poetry.'
AsBuming an attitude, she began'La Ligue des Bats :
fable de la Fontaine.'She then declaimed the little piece
with an attenUon to punctuation and emphasis, a flexibility
of Toioe and an appropriateness of gesture, very unusual

indeed at her age, and which prayed she had been oarefuDy
trained.
'Was it jonr mamma who taught yon that pieoe?* I
asked.
'Yes ; and she just used to say it in this way: " Qa'ayes
vous done? lui dit un de ces rats ; parlex I " She made me
lift my hand— so — to remind me to raise my voice ai the
question. * Now shall I dance for you ?'\
'No, that will do : but after your mamma went to the
Holy Virgin, as you say, with whom did you live then?*
'With Madame FrMSric and her husband: she took
care of me, but she is nothing related to me. I think she is
poor, for she had not so fine a house as mamma. I was not
long there. Mr. Rochester asked me if I would like to go
and live with him in England, and I said yes ; for I knew
Mr. Rochester before T knew Madame FrM^c» and he was
always kind to me and gave me pretty dresses and toys.
But you see he has not kept his word, for he has brought me
to England, and now he is gone back again himself, and I
never see him.*
After breakfast Adftle and I withdrew to the library;
which room, it appears, Mr. Rochester had directed shoidd
be used as the schoolroom. Most of the books were locked
up behind glass doors ; but there was one bookcase left open,
containing everything that could be needed in the way of
elementary works, and several volumes of light literature^
poetry, biography, travels, a few romances, & o. I suppose
he had considered that these were all the governess would
require for her private perusal ; and, indeed, they contented
me amply for the present ; compared with the scanty pick-
ings I had now and then been able to glean at Lowood, they
seemed to offer an abundant harvest of entertainment and
infoimation. In this room, too, there was a cabinet fttano,
quite new and of superior tone ; also an easel for painting,
and a pair of globes.
I found my pupil sufficiently docile, though disinclined to
apply : she had not been used to regular occupation of any

kiQcl. t felt it would be injudicious to oon6ne her too mnolt'
bI first ; BO, nhea I hod taUccd to her a great deal, and got
her to learn a little, and when the morning had advanced to
□ooQ, I allowed her to return to her nurse. I then proposed
to occupy myself till dinner-time in drawing some little
sketchea tor her use.
Ab I was going upstairs to fetch my portfolio and pencils,
Mis. Fairfax called to me :'Your morning school-hoars are
over DOW, I suppose,'said she. Shs was in a room the
folding-doorB of which stood open: I went in when she
Addressed me. It was a large, stately apartment, with purple
chairs and curtains, a Turkey carpet, walnut- panelled walls,
one vast window rich in stained glass, and a lofty ceiling,
nobly moulded. Mrs. Fairfax was dusting some vases of
fine purple spar, which stood on a sideboard.
'What a beautiful room I'I esclaimed, as I looked roond ;
for I had never before seen any half so imposing.
'Yes : this is the dining-room. I have just opened the
window, to let in a tittle air and sunshine ; for everythinf;
gets so damp in apartments that are seldom inhabited : the
drawing-room yonder feels like a vault'
She pointed to a wide arch corresponding to the window,
and hung like it with a Tynan-dyed curtain, now looped op.
Mounting to it by two broad steps and looking through, I
thought I caught a glimpse of a fairy place, so bright to my
novice eyes appeared the view beyond. Tet it was merely a
very pretty drawing-room, and within it a boudoir, both
spread with white carpets, on which seemed laid brilliant
garlands of flowers ; both ceiled with snowy mouldings ot
white grapes and vine-leaves, beneath which glowed in rich
contrast crimson couches and ottomans; while the ornsr
menta on the pele Parian mantelpiece were of sparkling
Bohemian glass, rtiby red ; and between the windows large
minora repeated the general blending of snow and fire.
'In what order yoU keep these rooms, Mrs. Faixfax 1'
said I.'No dust, no canvas coverings : except that the ur
(eels chilly, one would think they were inhabited daily.'

* Why, Miss Eyre, though Mr. Bochester's visits here are
rare, they are always sudden and unexpected; and as I
observed that it put him out to find everything swathed op,
and to have a bustle of arrangement on his arrival, I thought
it best to keep the rooms in readiness.'
'Is Mr. Rochester an exacting, fastidious sort of man ?'
'Not particularly so ; but he has a gentleman's tastes
and habits, and he expects to have things managed in con-
formity to them.*
'Do you like him 7 Is he generally liked 7'
< Oh, yes ; the family have always been respected here.
Almost all the land in this neighbourhood, as far as you
can see, has belonged to the Boqhesters time out of mind. "
'Well, but, leaving his land out of the question, do yoa
like him? Is he liked for himself 7'
'I have no cause to do otherwise than like him ; and
I believe he is considered a just and liberal landlord
by his tenants: but he has never lived much amongsi
them.'
'But has he no peculiarities 7 What, in short, is his
character ?'
'Oh ! his character is unimpeachable, I suppose. He is
rather peculiar, perhaps : he has travelled a great deal, and
seen a great deal of the world, I should think. I daresay
he is clever : but I never had much conversation with him.'
'In what way is he peculiar 7'
'I don't know — it is not easy to describe — nothing
striking, but you feel it when he speaks to you : you cannot
be always sure whether he is in jest or earnest, whether he
is pleased or the contrary ; you don't thoroughly understand
him, in short — at least, I don't : but it is of no consequence,
he is a very good master.'
This was all the accoimt I got from Mrs. Fairfax of her
employer and mine. There are people who seem to have no
notion of sketching a character, or observing and describing
salient points, either in persons or things : the good lady
evidently belonged to this class ; my queries puxzled, but
^r^'mm'^m iw ^ i— t^mi^w i i p i . l a ii i ipi

did not draw her oat. Mr. Rochester was ifr. Rochester
in her eyes ; s gentJemoi], a landed proprietor — nothing
more : she inquired and searched no further, and evidently
wondered at my wish to gain a more definite notion of his
identity.
When we left the dining-room, she proposed to show me
over the rest of the house ; and I Cottoned her upstairs and
downstairs, adminng as I wont ; for all was wotl arranged
and handsome. The targe front chambers I thought espe-
dally grand; and some of the tbird-etory rooms, though
dark and low, were interesting from their air of antiquity.
The furniture once appropriated to the lower apartments had
from time to time been removed here, as fashions changed;
and the imperfeot light entering by their narrow casements
showed bedsteads of a hundred years old ; chests in oak or
walnut, looking, with their strange carvings of pabn branches
and cherubs'heads, like types of the Hebrew ark ; rows of
venerable chairs, high-backed and narrow ; stools still more
antiquated, on whose cushioned tops were yet apparent
traces of half-effaced embroideries, wrought by fingers tliat
for two generatiODB had been coffin-dust. All these relics
gave to the third story of Thomfield Hall the aspect of a
home of the past : a shrine of memory. I liked ^e bush,
the gloom, the quaintness of these retreats in the day; but I
by no means ooveted a night's repose on one of those wide
and heavy beds : shut in, some of them, with doors of oak;
shaded, others, with wrought old-Enghsh hangings crusted
with thick work, portraying effigies of strange flowers, and
stranger Inrds, and strangest - bnmaa beings, — all which
would have looked strange, indeed, by the pallid gleam of
moonlighL
'Do the servants sleep in these rooms 7'I asked.
'No ; they occupy a range of smaller apartments to the
back ; no one ever sleeps here : one would almost say that,
if there were a ghost at Thom & eld Hall, this would be its
haunL'
'Bo I think : yon have no ghost, then 7'

'None that I ever heard of»'returned Mrs. Eairfu,
smiling.
'Nor any traditions of one 7 no legends or ghost stories ? *
< I believe not. And yet it is said the Bochesters have
been rather a violent than a quiet race in their time : per-
haps, though, that is the reason they rest tranquilly in their
graves now.'
< Yes— " after life's fitful fever they deep well.''* I
muttered.'Where are you going now, Mrs. Eairfax?'for
she was moving away.
'On to the leads ; will you come and see the view from
thence ?'I followed still, up a very narrow staircase to the
attics, and thence by a ladder and through a trap-door to the
roof of the hall. I was now on a level with the crow oolony»
and could see into their nests. T < eaning oyer the battle-
ments and looking far down, I surveyed the grounds
out like a map : the bright and velvet lawn closely
the grey base of the mansion; the field, wide as a park,
dotted with its ancient timber; the wood, dun and sere,
divided by a path visibly overgrown, greener with moss than
the trees were with foliage; the church at the gates, the
road, the tranquil hills, all reposing in the autumn day's
sun : the horizon bounded by a propitious sky, azure, mar-
bled with pearly white. No feature in the scene was extra-
ordinary, but all was pleasing. When I turned from it and
repassed the trap-door, I could scarcely see my way down
the ladder: the attic seemed black as a vault compared
with that arch of blue air to which I had been looking up,
and to that sunlit scene of grove, pasture, and green hill of
which the hall was the centre, and over which I had been
gazing with delight.
Mrs. Fairfax stayed behind a moment to fasten the trap-
door ; I, by dint of groping, found the outlet from the attio,
and proceeded to descend the narrow garret staircase. I
lingered in the long passage to which this led, separating
the front and back rooms of the third story : narrow, low,
and dim, with only one little window at the far end, and
t^^i^fmwmm^mt^^^^i^^mm^m^mmmmm^Hmi^^mmmm
I

looking, with its two rows of small black doors all shut, li^
a corridor in soma Bluebeard's castle.
While I paced softly on the last sound I expected to
hear in so still a region, a laugh, struck my ear. It was 4
curious laugh ; distinct, formal, mirthless. I stopped : the
sound ceased, only for an instant; it began again louder:
for at first, though distinct, it was very low. It passed oB
in a clamorous peal that seemed to wake an echo in ever;
lonely chamber ; though it originated but in one, and I could
have pointed out the door whence the accents issued.
'Mrs. Fairfax I'I called out ; for I now heard her
descending ^e great stairs.'Did yoa hear that loud laugb 7
Whoisil?'
'Some of the servants, very likely,'she answered;
* perhaps Grace Poole.'
'Did you hear it 7'I again inquired.
'Yes, plainly : I often hear her ; she sews in one of these
rooms. Sometimes Leah is with her : they are frequentlj
noisy together.'
The laugh was repeated in its low, Byllabto tone, aod
terminated in an odd mnrmnr.
'Grace t'excbumed Mrs. Fairfax.
I really did not expect any Grace to answer; for the
laugh was as tragic, as preternatural a laugh as any I ever
heard ; and, bat that it was high noon, and that no circom-
stance of ghofltliness accompanied the curious cEtohinnation,
but that neither scene nor season favoured fear, I should
have been Buperstitioosly afraid. However, the event
showed me I was a fool for eDtertaining a sense even of
Kurpriae.
The door nearest me opened, and a servant came oat,—
a woman of between thirty and forty ; a set, sqnare-made
figure, red-haired, and with a hard, plain face : any apparition
less romantic or less ghostly could scarcely be conceived.
'Too much noise, Grace,'said Mrs. Fairfax.'Bemember
directions I'Grace cuitseyed silently and went in.

running to meet us in the hall, exclaiming, — ^ " Mesdames,

The promise of a smootb career, which my first calm
introduction to Thomfield Hall seemed to pledge, was not
belied on a longer aquaintance with the place and its
inmates. Mra. Fairfax turned out to be what she appeared,
a placid-tempered, kind-oatured woman, of competent
education and average intelligence. My pupil was a lively
child, who had been spoilt and indulged, and therefore
was sometimes wayward ; but as she was committed
entirely to my care, and no injudicious interference from
any qiiarter ever thwarted my plans for her improvement,
she soon forgot her little freaks, and became obedient
and teachable. She had no great talents, no marked traits
of character, no peculiar development of feeling or taste
which raised her one inch above the ordinary level of child-
hpod ; but neither had she any deficiency or vice which Bunb
ber below it. She made reasonable progress, entertained
for me a vivacious, though perhaps not very profound,
affection ; and by her simplicity, gay prattle, and efforts to
please, inspired me, in return, with a degree of attEtebmeut
sufficient to make us both content in eEich other's society.
This, par parenlhise, will be thought cool language by
persona who entertun solemn doctrines about the angelic
nature of children, and the duty of those charged with their
edacation to conceive for them an idolatrous devotion : but
I am not writing to flatter parental egotism, to echo cant, or
prop up humbug ; I am merely telling the truth. I felt a
conscientious solicitude for Ad & le's welfare and progress,
and a quiet liking to her little self ; just as I cherished
towards Mrs. Fairfax a thankfulness for her kindness, and a
II Midi I ii > MfcBlUai^BB^MMMMMMMi»i
<
JANE EYBB 129
pleasure in her society proportionate to the tranquil regard
she had for me, and the moderation of her mind and
character.
Anybody may blame me who likes when I add further
I that now and then, when I took a walk by myself in ihe
I grounds, when I went down to the gates and looked
through them along the road, or when, while Ad^le played
with her nurse, and Mrs. Fairfax made jellies in the store-
room, I climbed the three staircases, raised the trap-door of
j the attic, and having reached the leads, looked out afar
: over sequestered field and hill, and along dim sky-line — ^ihai
; then I longed for a power of vision which might overpass
that Umit; which might reach the busy world, towns,
regions full of life I had heard of but never seen : that then
I desired more of practical experience than I possessed ; more
of intercourse with my kind, of acquaintance with variety of
character, than was here within my reach. I valued what
was good in Mrs. Fairfax, and what was good in Ad^ ;
but I believed in the existence of other and more vivid lands
of goodness, and what I believed in I wished to behold,
j Who blames me? Many, no doubt; and I shall be
j called discontented. I could not help it: the restlessness
; was in my nature ; it agitated me to pain sometimes. Then
j my sole relief was to walk along the corridor of the third
i story, backwards and forwards, safe in the silence and
j solitude of the spot and allow my mind's eye to dwell on
j whatever bright visions rose before it — and, certainly, they
1 were many and glowing ; to let my heart be heaved by the
i exultant movement, which, while it swelled it in trouble,
j expanded it with life ; and, best of all, to open my inward
I ear to a tale that was never ended — a tale my imagina-
^ tion created, and narrated continuously ; quickened with all
I of incident, life, fire, feeling, that I desired and had not in
my actual existence.
It is in vain to say human beings ought to be satisfied
with tranquillity: they must have action; and they will
make it if they cannot fiind iU. Millions are condemned
•■-.•x .

to a sUIIer doom than mine, and millions are in eilent revolt
againtit their lot. Nobody knows how many rebelHoas besides
political rebellioDB ferment in the masses of life which people
earth. Women are supposed to be very calm generally : but
women feel just as men feel; they need exercise for their
faculties and a field for their efforts as much as their brothers
do ; they suffer from too rigid a restraint, too absolute a stagna-
tion, precisely as men would suffer ; and it is narrow-minded
in their mora privileged fellow-creaturea to say that they
ought to confine themselves to making puddings and knitUng
stockings, to playing on the piano and embroidering hags.
It is thoughtless to condemn them, or laugh at them, if they
seek to do more or learn more than custom has pronounced
necessary for their sex.
When thus alone I not nnfrequently heard Grace Poole's
laugh : the sanie peal, the same low, slow ha I ha I which,
when first heard, had thrilled me : I heard, too, her eocentrie
murmurs ; stranger than her laugh. There were days when
she was quite silent; but there were others when I could
not account for the sounds she made. Sometimes I saw her ;
she would come out of her room with a basin, or a plate, or
a tray in her hand, go down to the kitchen, and shortly return,
generally (oh, romantic reader, forgive ma for telling the
plun truth :) bearing a pot of porter. Her appearance
always acted as a damper to the curiosity nused by her oral
oddities : hard-featured and staid, she had no point to which
interest could attach. I made some attempts to draw her
into conversation, but she seemed a person of few words : a
monosyllabic reply usually out short every effort of that sort
The other members of the household, viz. John and his
wife, Leah the housemaid, and Sophie the French nurse,
were decent people : but in no respect remarkable. With
Sophie I used to talk French, and sometimes I asked her
questioDB about her native country; but she was not of
a descriptive or narrative turn, and generally gave such
vapid and confused answers as were calculated rather to
check than encourage inqoiry.

October, November^ Deoember passed away. One after-
noon in January Mrs. Fairfax had begged a holiday for
Adele because she had a cold ; and, as Ad^e seconded the
request with an ardour that reminded me how predooa
occasional holidays had been to me in my own childhood, I
accorded it, deeming that I did well in showing pliability on
the point. It was a fine, calm day, though very cold ; I was
tired of sitting still in the library through a whole long
morning : Mrs. Fairfax had just written a letter which was
waiting to be posted, so I put on my bonnet and doak and
volunteered to carry it to Hay ; the distance, two nulea*
would be a pleasant winter afternoon walk. Ebkving seen
Ad^le comfortably seated in her Utde chair by Mrs. Fairfax's
parlour fireside, and ^iven her her best wax doll (which I
usually kept enveloped in silver paper in a drawer) to play
with, and a story-book for change of amusement; and
having replied to her'Bevenez bient6t, ma bonne amie, ma
ch6re Mdlle. Jeannette,'with a kiss, I set out.
The ground was hard, the air was still, my road was
lonely ; I walked fast till I got warm, and then I walked
slowly to enjoy and analyse the species of pleasure brooding
for me in the hour and situation. It was three o'clock ; the
church bell tolled as I passed under the belfry : the charm of
the hour lay in its approaching dimness, in the low-gliding
and pale-beaming sun. I was a mile from Thomfield, in a
lane noted for wild roses in simimer, for nuts and black-
berries in autmnn, and even now possessing a few coral
treasures in hips and haws, but whose best winter delight
lay in its utter solitude and leafless repose. If a breath of
air stirred, it made no sound here ; for there was not a holly,
not an evergreen to rustle, and the stripped hawthorn and
hazel bushes were as still as the white, worn stones which
causewayed the middle of the path. Far and wide, on each
side, there were only fields, where no cattle now browsed ; and
the little brown birds, which stirred occasionally in the hedge,
looked Uke single russet leaves that had forgotten to drop.
This lane inclined uphill all the way to Hay: having
/
f

JANE EYBB
reached the midclle I sat down oo a stile which led thence
into ft field. Gathering my mantle about me, and sheltering
my hands in my muff, I did not feel the cold, though it froze
keenly ; as was attested by a sheet of ice covering the cause-
way, where a little brooklet, now congealed, bad overflowed
after a rapid thaw some days since. From my seat I could
look down on Thornfield : the grey and hattlemented hall was
the principal object in the vale below me; its woods and
'dark rookery rose against the west. I lingered till the sun
went down amongst the trees, and sank crimsoD and clear
behind them. I then turned eastward.
On the hilltop above me sat the rising moon ; pale yet as
a cloud, but brightening momently : she looked over Hay,
which, half tost in trees, sent up a blue smoke from its few
chimneys; it was yet a mile distant, but in the absolute
bush I could hear plainly its thin murmurs of life. My ear
too felt the flow of currents ; in what dales and depths I could
not tell; but there were many hills beyond Hay, and
doubtless mii.ny becks threading their pusses. That evening
coLn betrayed alike the tinkle of the nearest streams, the
sough of the most remote.
A rude noise broke on these fine ripplings and whisper-
ings, at ODOe so far away and so clear: a positive trompi
kamp; a metallic clatter, which effaced the soft wave-
wanderings ; as, in a picture, the solid moss of a crag, or the
rough boles of a great oak, drawn in dark and strong on the
foreground, efface the aerial distance of azure hill, sunny
horizon, and blended clouds, where tint melts into tint.
The dio was on the causeway ; a horse was coming ; the
windings of the lane yet hid it, bat it approached. I was
jast leaving the stile ; yet, as the path waa narrow, I sat
still to let it go by. In those days I was young, and all
sorts of fancies bright and dark tenanted my mind : the
memories of nursery stories were there amongst other
rubbish ; and when they recurred, maturing youth added to
them a vigour and vividness beyond what childhood could
give. As this horse approached, and as I watched for it to
i*iiMfai|i^i^,^^ifaMi^[jMBfc^^i^Mda» I!** * ■■■
JANE EYBB 133
appear through the dusk, I remembered oertdn of Bessie's
tales, wherein figured a North-of-Engla;nd spirit, called a
< Gytrash/ which, in the form of horse, mule, or large dog,
haunted solitary ways, and sometimes came upon belated
travellers, as this horse was now coming upon me.
It was very near, but not yet in sight, when, in addition
to the tramp, tramp, I heard a rush under the hedge, and
close down by the hazel stems glided a great dog, whose
black and white colour made him a distinct object against
the trees. It was exactly one mask of Bessie's Gytrash, — a
lion-like creature with long hair and a huge head : it passed
me, however, quietly enough ; not staying to look up, with
strange pretercanine eyes, in my face, as I half expected it
would. The horse ^gllowed, — a tall steed, and on its baek a
rider. The man, the human being, broke the spell at onoe.
Nothing ever rode the Gytrash : it was always alone ; and
goblins, to my notions, though they might tenant the dumb
carcases of beasts, could scarce covet shelter in the oommon*
place human form. No Gytrash was this, — only a traveller
taking the short cut to Millcote. He passed, and I went on : —
a few steps, and I turned : a sliding sound and an exclama-
tion of'What the deuce is to do now ?'and a clattering .
tumble, arrested my attention. Man and horse were down ;'^
they had slipped on the sheet of ice which glased the cause-
way. The dog came bounding back, and seeing his master
in a predicament, and hearing the horse groan, barked till
the evening hills echoed the sound, which was deep in
proportion to his magnitude. He snuffed round the prostrate
group, and then he ran up to me ; it was all he could do, —
there was no other help at hand to summon. I obeyed him,
and walked down to the traveller, by this time struggling
himself free of his steed. His efforts were so vigorous I
thought he could not be much hurt ; but I asked him the
question :— « Are you injured, sir?'. j
I think he was swearing, but am not certain ; however,
he was pronouncing some formula which prevented him
from replying to me directly.

I
1» JANE E7RE
'Can I do anything ?'I asked agua.
'You must just stand on one side,'he answered as he rose,
first to his knees, aud then to his feet. I did ; whereupon
began a heaving, stamping, clattering process, accompanied
by a harking and baying which removed me elTectuatly some
yards'distance ; but I would not be driven quite away tiU 1
saw the event. This was finally fortunate ; the horse was
re-established, and the dog was silenced with a'Down,
Filot 1'The traveller now, stooping, felt his foot and leg, as
if trying whether they were sound ; apparently something
ailed them, for he hailed to the stile whence I had just risen,
aod sat down.
I was in the mood for being useful, or at least officious,!
think, for I now drew near him again.
'If you are hurt, and want help, sir, I can fetch some
one either from Thomfield Hall or from Hay.'
'Thank yon ; I shall do: I have no broken bones— only
a sprain ;'and again he stood up and tried his foot, but the
resnlt extorted an involuntary'Ugh 1'
Something of daylight still lingered, and the moon was
waxing bright : I could see him plainly. His figure was
enveloped in a riding cloak, fur collared, and steal clasped ;
its detiuls were not apparent, but I traced the general points
of middle height, and considerable breadth of chest. He
had a dark face, with stem features and a heavy brow ; hla
eyes and gathered eyebrows looked ireful and thwarted just
now ; he was past youth, bnt had not reached middle age ;
perhaps he might be thirty-five. I felt no fear of him, and
bat little shyness. Had he been a handsome, heroic-looking
young gentleman, I should not have dared to stand thus
questioning him against his will, and offering my services
unasked. I bad hardly ever seen a handsome youth ; never
in my life spoken to one. I had a theoretical reverence and
homage for beauty, elegance, gallantry, fascination ; but had
I met those qualitJes incarnate in masonline shape, I should
have known instinctively that they neither had nor could
have sympathy vrith anything in me, and should have

way ai^d not felt any vocation to renew inquiries : but the
frown^^the roughness of the traveller, set me at my ease:
I retained my station when he waved to me to go, and
announced : —'I cannot think of leaving you, sir, at so late
an hour, in this solitary lane, till I see you are fit to mount

He looked at me when I. said this :• he had hurdly turned
his eyes in my direction before.

he,'if you have a home in this neighbourhood : where do

* From just below ; and I am not at all afraid of being

* You live just below — do you mean at that house with

moon cast a hoary gleam, bringing it out distinct and pale
from the woods, that, by contrast with the western sky, now
seemed one mass of shadow.

'Mr. Rochester's.'
'Do you know Mr. Rochester?*

bat when told to do it I was disposed to obey. I put down
my muff od the stile, and went up to the tall steed ; I en-
deavoured to'catch the bridle, but it was a spirited thing,
and would not let me come near its head ; I made effort on
effort, though in vain : meantime, I was mortally afraid of its

some time, and at last he laog^ied.

made the effort, for it wrenched his sprain.'

A touch of a spurred heel made his horse first siaft and
rear, and then bound away; the dog rushed in his traces:
all three vanished.
Like heath that, in the wildenieM»
The wild wizid whirls awaj.
I took up my muff and walked on. The incident had
occurred and was gone for me : it was an incident of no
moment, no romance, no interest in a sense ; yet it marked
Nvith change one single hour of a monotonous life. My help
had been needed and cliumed ; I had given it : I was pleased
to have done something ; trivial, transitory though the deed
was, it was yet an active thing, and I was weary of an
existence all passive. The new face, too, was like a new
picture introduced to the gallery of memory ; and it was
dissimilar to all the others hanging there : firstly, because it
was masculine ; and, secondly, because it was dark, strongs
and stem. I had it still before me when I entered Hay,
and slipped the letter into the post-office; I saw it as I —
walked fast down hill all the way home. When I came to
the stile, I stopped a minute, looked round and listened, with
an idea that a horse's hoof might ring on the causeway again,
and that a rider in a cloak, and a Gytrash-like Newfoundland
dog, might be again apparent : I saw only the hedge and a
pollard willow before me, rising up still and straight to meet
the moonbeams; I heard only the faintest waft of wind
roaming fitful among the trees round Thomfield, a mile
distant ; and when I glanced down in the direction of the
murmur, my eye, traversing the hall-front, caught a light
kindling in a window : it reminded me that I was late, and
I hurried on.
I did not like re-entering Thomfield. To pass its thresh*
old was to return to stagnation ; to cross the silent hall, to
ascend the darksome staircase, to seek my own lonely little
room, and then to meet tranquil Mrs. Fairfax, and spend
the long winter evening with her, and her only, was to quell
wholly the faint excitement wakened by my walk, — to slip

138 JANE EYBE
sg & in over my faculties the viewless fetters of an umfonn
ftod loo Btill existence ; of an existence whose very privileges
of aecuiity and ease I was becoming incapable of appreciating.
What good it would have done me at that time to have been
tossed in the storms of an uncertain struggling life, and to
have been taught by rough and bitter experience to long for
the calm amidst which I now repined ! Yes, just as much
good as it would do a man tired of sitting still in a'too easy
ch^'to tahe a long walk ; and just as natural was the wish
to stir, under my circumstances, as it would be under his.
I hngered at the gates ; I lingered on the lawn ; I paced
backwards and forWEirds on the pavement : the shutters of
the glass door were closed ; I coiJd not see into the interior ;
aud both my eyes and spirit seemed drawn from the gloomy
house— from the grey hollow filled with rayless cells, as it
appeared to me— to that sky expanded before me, — a blue
■ea absolved from taint of cloud ; the moon ascending it in
solemn march ; her orb seeming to look up as she left the
hilltops, from behind which she had come, far and farther
below her, and aspired to the zenith, midnight-dark in its
fathomless depth and measureless distance : and for those
trembling stars that followed her course ; they made my
heart tremble, my veins glow when I viewed them. Little
things recall us to earth : the dock slruok in the hall ; that
sufficed ; I turned from moon and stars, opened a side door,
aod went in.
The ball was not dark, nor yet was it lit, only by the
high-bung bronze lamp : a warm glow suffused both it and
the lower steps of the oak staircase. This ruddy shine issued
from the great dining-room, whose two-leaved door stood
open, and showed a genial fire in the grate, glancing on
marble hearth and brass fireirons, and revealing purple
draperies and polished furniture, in the most pleasant radiance.
It revealed, too, a group near the mantelpiece : I had scaroely
caught it, and scarcely become aware of a cheerful mingling
< A voices, amongst which I seemed to distinguish the tones
of Ad & le, when the door closed.

\ I hastened to Mrs. Eairfax's room : there was a fire there
] too, but no candle, and no Mrs. Fairfax. Instead, all alone^
sitting upright on the rug, and gazing with gravity at .the
t blaze, I beheld a great black and white long-haired dog, just
! like the Gytrash of the lane. It was so like it that I went
forward and said —'Pilot/ and the thing got up and came to
me and snuffed me. I caressed him, and he wagged his
great tail : but he looked an eerie creature to be alone with,
and I could not tell whence he had come. I rang the bell, for
I wanted a candle ; and I wanted, too, to get an accomit of

I -What dog is this?'
'He came with n\aster/
•With whom?'
'With master — Mr. Bochester — ^he is just arrived.'
'Indeed 1 and is Mrs. Fairfax with him ?'
;'Yes, and Miss Adela ; they are in the dimng-room, and
John is gone for a surgeon : for master has had an acoident ;
i his horse fell and his ankle is sprained.'
{'Did the horse fall in Hay Lane ?'
i'Yes, coming down hill ; it slipped on some ioe.'
i'Ah I Bring me a candle, will yon, Leah ?'
i Leah brought it ; she entered, followed by Mrs. Fairfax:,
I who repeated the news ; adding that Mr. Carter the surgeon
was come, and was now with Mr. Rochester: then she
, hurried out to give orders about tea, and I went upstairs to
take off my things.

CHAFTER xni
Mr. BocBBnEB, it seemB, by the surgeon's orders, went to
bed early that aigbt ; Dor did he rise soon next morning.
Whea he did come down, it was to attend to business : his
agent and some of hia tenants were arrived, and waiting to
speak with him.
Adile and I had now to vacate the library : it would be in
daily requisition as a reception-room for callers. A fire was
lit in as apartment upstairs, and there I carried our boob,
and arranged it for the future schoolroom. I discerned in
the course of the morning that Thomfield Hall was a
changed place : no longer silent as a church, it echoed
every hour or two to a knock at the door, or a clang of the
bell ; steps, too, often traversed the hall, and new voices
^ > oke in different keys below ; a rill from the outer world
was flowing through it ; it had a master : for my part I
liked it better.
Adila was not easy to teach that day ; she could not
apply : she kept running to the door and looking over the
banisters to see if she could get a glimpse of Mr. Rochester ;
then she coined pretexts to go downstairs, in order, as I
shrewdly suspected, to visit the hbrary, where I knew she
was not wanted ; then, when I got a little angry, and made
her sit still, she continued to talk incessantly of her'ami.

(I had not before heard his prenoraeos), and to conjecture
what presents he had brought her : for it appears he bad

Millcote there would be found amongst it a litUe box in
whose contents she had an interest.
'Et cela doit signifier/ said she,'qu'il y aura U dedans un
cadeau pour moi, et peutdtre pour vous aussi, mademoiselle.
Monsieur a parl6 de vous : il m'a demand^ le nom de ma
gouvemante, et si elle n'6tait pas une petite personne,
mince et un peu pdle. J'ai dit qu'oui : car o'est yrai, nV
ce pas, mademoiselle ?'
I and my pupil dined as usual in Mrs. EGbir(ax*8 parlour
the afternoon was wild and snowy, and we passed it in the
schoolroom. At dark I allowed Ad & le to put away books
and work, and to run downstairs ; for, from the comparative
silence below, and from the cessation of appeals to the do6rw
bell, I conjectured that Mr. Bochester was now at liberty.
Left alone, I walked to the window ; but nothing was to be
seen thence : twilight and snowflakes together thickened the
air, and hid the very shrubs on the lawn. I let down the
curtain and went back to the fireside.
In the clear embers I was tracing a view, not unUke a
picture I remembered to have seen of the castle of Heidel*
berg, on the Rhine, when Mrs. Fairfax came in, breaking up
by her entrance the fiery mosaic I had been piecing together.
and scattering too some heavy unwelcome thoughts that were
beginning to throng on my soUtude.
'Mr. Bochester would be glad if you and your pupil would
take tea with him in the drawing-room this evening,'said she :
'he has been so much engaged all day that he could not ask
to see you before.'
'When is his tea-time ?'I inquired.
'Oh, at six o'clock : he keeps early hours in the country.
You had better change your frock now ; I will go with yoo
and fasten it. Here is a candle.'*
'Is it necessary to change my frock ?'
'Yes, you had better: I always dress for the evening
when Mr. Rochester is here.'
This additional ceremony seemed somewhat stately : haw^ \
ever, I repaired to my room, and, with Mrs. Fairfax's aid.

I
JANE EYRB
3%placed my black stuff dress by one of black silk: the best
^nd the only additional one I had, esoept one of light grey,
" which, in my Lowood notions of the toilette, I thought too
^^e to be worn, except on first-mte occasions.
'You i^ant ft brooch,'said Mrs. Fairfax. I had a single
Xttle pearl ornament which Misa Temple gave me as a part-
ing keepsake ; I put it on, and then we went downstairs,
TToused as I was to strangers, it was rather a trial to appear
thus formally summoned in Mr. Rochester's presence. I let
^ra- Fairfax precede me into the dining-room, and kept in
her shade as we crossed that apartment ; and, passing the
arcb, whose curtain was now droppod, entered the elegant
recess beyond.
Two wax candles stood Hghted on the table, and two on
the mantelpiece ; basking in the light and heat of a superb
fire lay Pilot — AdMe knelt near him. Half reclined on a
couch appeared Mr. Bochester, his foot supported by the
cushion ; he was looking at Ad^le and the dog : the fire shone
fall on his face. I knew my traveller with bis broad and
jetty eyebrows; his 6 < ]uare forehead, made squarer by the
horizontal sweep of his black hair. I recognised hia decisive
nose, more remarkable for character than beauty ; his full
nostrils, denoting, I thought, choler ; bis grim mouth, chin,
and jaw — yes, all three were very grim, and no mistake.
His shape, now divested of cloak, I perceived harmonised in
squareness with his physiognomy : I suppose it was a good
figure in the athletic sense of the term — broad-chested and
thin-fianked, though neither tall nor graceful
Mr. Bochester must have been aware of the entrance of
Mrs. Fairfax and myself ; bnt it appeared he was not in the
mood to notice us, (or he never lifted his head as we
approached.
'Here is Miss Eyre, sir,'said Mrs. Fairfax, in her qniet
way. He bowed, still not taking bis eyes from the group of
the dog and child.
'Let Miss Eyre be seated,'said be : and there was some-
thing in the forced stiff bow, in the impatient yet formal tone.

which seemed further to express, * What the deuoe is it to me
whether Miss Eyre be there or not ? At this moment I am
not disposed to accost her/
I sat down quite disembarrassed. A reception of finished
politeness would probably have confused me : I oould nol
have returned or repaid it by answering grace and eleganoa
on my part ; but harsh caprice laid me under no obligaticm ;
on the contrary, a decent quiescence, under the freak of
manner, gave me advantage. Besides, the eccentricity of the
proceeding was piquant: I felt interested to see how he
would go on.
He went on as a statue would, that is, he neither spoke
nor moved. Mrs. Fairfax seemed to think it necessary thai
some one should be amiable, and she began to talk. Kindly,
as usual — and, as usual, rather trite — she condoled with him
on the pressure of business he had had all day; on the
annoyance it must have been to him with that painful sprain :
then she commended his patience and perseverance in going
through with ii
'Madam, I should like some tea,'was the sole rejoinder
she got She hastened to ring the bell ; and, when the tray
came, she proceeded to arrange the cups, spoons, ftc., with
assiduous celerity. I and AdMe went to the table ; but the
master did not leave hb couch. ^
'Will you hand Mr. Rochester's cup?'said Mrs. Esirfax
to me ;'Ad61e might perhaps spill it.'
I did as requested. As he took the cup from my hand,
Ad61e, thinking the moment propitious for making a request
in my favour, cried out: —'N'est-ce pas, monsieur, qn'il y a
un cadeau pour Mademoiselle Eyre, dans votre petit coffire?*
'Who talks of cadeaux?'said he grufl9y:'did yoa
expect a present, Miss Eyre ?• Are you fond of presents 7'
and he searched my face with eyes that I saw were dark,
irate, and piercing.
'I hardly know, sir ; I have little experience of them :
they are generally thought pleasant things.'
'Generally thought ? But what do you think ?'
I
144 JANE EYRB
'I should be obliged to take time, sir, beFore I could give
you an answer worthy of your aoceptance: a present has
many faces to it, has it not? and one should consider all
before pronouncing an opinion as to its nature.'
'Miss Byre, yon are not bo unsophisticated ae Addle :
she demands a " cadeau, " clamorouBly, the moment she sees
me : you beat about the bush.'
'Becaose I h & 7e less confidence in my deserts than
Ad & Ie has: she can prefer the claim of old acquaintance,
and tbe right too of custom ; for she says you have always
been in the habit of giving her playthings ; but if I had to
make out a case I should be puzzled, since I am a stranger,
and have done nothing to entitle me to an acknowledg-
ment'
'Oh, don't fall back on over-modesty 1 I have examined
Ad^e, and find you have taken great pains with her ; she is
not bright, she has no talents ; yet in a short time she has
mads much improvement.'
'Sir, you have now ^vec me my " cadeau " ; I am
obliged to you : it is the meed teachers most covet ; praise
of their pupil's progress.'
'Humph 1'said Mr. Bochester, and he took his tea in

taken away, and Ure. Fairfax had settled into a comer with
her knitting ; while AdMe was leading me by the band round
the room, showing me tbe beautiful books and ornaments
on the consoles and chiffonoi^res. We obeyed, aa in duty
bound ; Adile wanted to take a seat on my knee, but she
was ordered to amuse herself with IHlot

half the time in such a plaoe would have done up any con-
stitution I No wonder you have rather the look of another

When you came on me in Hay Lane last night, I thought
unaccountably of fairy tales, and had half a mind to demand
whether you had bewitched my horse : I am not sura yek
Who are your parents? *

'Nor ever had, I suppose : do you remember them ?'

'For whom, sir?'
'For the men in green: it was a proper moonlight
evening for them. Did I break through one of your, rings,
that you spread that damned ice on the causeway ?'
I shook my head.'The men in green all forsook
England a hundred years ago,'said I, speaking as seriously
as he had done.'And not even in Hay Lane, or the fields
about it, could you find a trace of them. I don't think
either summer or harvest, or winter moon, will ever shine
on their revels more.'
Mrs. Fairfax had dropped her knitting, and. with raised
eyebrows, seemed wondering what sort of talk this was.
'Well,'resumed Mr. Rochester,'if you disown parents
you must have some sort of kinsfolk : uncles and aunts ? *
'No ; none that I ever saw/
'And your home ?'
'I have none.'
'Where do your brothers and sisters live ? *
'I have no brothers or sisters.'.
'Who recommended you to come here ? *

we were upon,'and I am daily thankful for the choioe

Mr. Rochester:'eulogiumd will not bias me; I ahall judge

The widow looked bewildered. ■
'Miss Eyre, have you ever lived in a town 7'H
'No, sir.'
'Have you seen much society ?'
'Kone but the pupils and teachers of Lowood ; and now
the inmates of Thomfield,'
'Have you read much ?'
'Only such books as came in my way ; and they have not
been numerous or very learned.'
* YoQ have hved the life of a nun : no doubt you are well
drilled in religions forms ; — Brocklehurat, who I understand

needles and thread, with which we conld hardly sew.'
'That was very false economy,'remarked Mrs. Furfax,
who now again caught the drift of the dialogue.
'And was that the head and front of his offending?'
demanded Mr. Boohester.
'He starved ns when he had the sole superintendence
of the provision department, before the committee was

about sudden deaths and judgments, which made us aEraid
to go to bed.'
'What age were you when you went to Lowood?'
* About ten.'
'And you stayed there eight years : you are now, then,
eighteen?'
I assented.
'Arithmetic, you see, is useful ; without its aid I should
hardly have been able to guess your age. It is a point diffi-
cult to fix where the features and countenance are so much
at variance as in your case. And now, what did you learn al
Lowood ? Can you play ?'
« A little.'
'Of course : that is the established answer. Go into the
Ubrary — I mean, if you please. (Excuse my tone of
command ; I am used to say " Do this, " and it is done : I
cannot alter my customary habits for one new inmate.)
Go, then, into the library ; teke a candle with you ; leave the
door open ; sit down to the piano, and play a tune.'
I departed, obeying his directions.

tinued :

said were yours. I don't know whether they were entirely
of your doing : probably a master aided you ?'
'No, indeed I'I interjected.

if you can vouch for its contents being original ; but don't
pass your word unless you are certain: I can recognise
patchwork.'
'Then I will say nothing, and you shall judge for yoor^
self, sir.'
I brought the portfolio from the library.
'Approach the table,'said he ; and I wheeled it to hii

couch. Addle and Mra. " Fairfax drew near to see the
pictures.
'No crowding,'said Mr. Bochester :'talte the drawings
from my hand as I finish with theoi ; but don't push your
faces up to mine.'
He deliberately Bcrutinised each sketch and painting.
Three he laid aside ; the others, when he had examined them,
he swept from him.
'Take them o(T to the other table, Mrs. Fairfax,'said be,
'and look at them with Adfele ; — you'(glancing at me)
'resume your seat, and answer my questions. I perceive
these pictures were done by one hand : was that hand
yours?'
•Yes.'
'And when did yon 6nd time to do them ? They have
taken much time, and some thought.'
't did them in the last two vacations I spent at Lowood,
when I had no other occupation.'
'Where did yon get your coiuea 7 *
'Out of my head.'
'That head I see now on yonr shoulders 7'
Yes, sir.'
Has it other famitnre of the same kind within?'
'I should think it may have : I should hope—better.*
Be spread the pictures before him, and again surveyed
them alternately.

embody them, they were striking ; but my hand would not
second my fancy, and in each case it bad wrought out but %

'sented clouds low and livid, rolling over a swollen sea : all
the distance was in eclipse ; so, too, was the foreground ;
or, rather, the nearest billows, for there was no land. One

gleam of light lifted into relief a half-submerged mast, 611
which sat a cormorant, dark and large, with wings flecked
with foam : its beak held a gold bracelet, set with gems, that
I had touched with as brilliant tints as my palette could
yield, and as glittering distinctness as my pendl could im*
part. Sinking below the bird and mast, a drowned corpse
glanced through the green water ; a fair arm was the only
limb clearly visible, whence the bracelet had been washed
or torn.
The second picture contained for foreground only the dim
peak of a hill, with grass and some leaves slanting as if by
a breeze. Beyond and above spread an expanse of sky,
dark blue as at twilight : rising into the sky was a woman's
shape to the bust, portrayed in tints as dusk and soft as I
could combine. The dim forehead was crowned with a star ;
the lineaments below were seen as through the suffusion of
vapour ; the eyes shone dark and wild ; the hair streamed
shadowy, like a beamless cloud torn by storm or by eleotrie
travail. On the neck lay a pale reflection like moonlight;
the same faint lustre touched the train of thin doude
from which rose and bowed this vision of the Evening
Star.
The third showed the pinnacle of an iceberg piercing a
polar winter sky : a muster of northern lights reared their
dim lances, close serried, along the horizon. Throvdng these
into distance, rose, in the foreground, a head, — a colossal
head, inclined towards the iceberg, and resting against il
Two thin hands, joined under the forehead, and supporting
it, drew up before the lower features a sable veil ; a brow
quite bloodless, white as bone, and an eye hollow and fixed,
blank of meaning but for the glassiness of despair, alone
were visible. Above the temples, amidst wreathed turban
folds of black drapery, vague in its character and consistency
as cloud, gleamed a ring of white flame, gemmed with
sparkles of a more lurid tinge. This pale crescent was'The
Ukeness of a Kingly Crown'; what it diademed was * the
shape which shape had none.'

his brother as to be still inconsolable for his loss?'
'Why, no — ^perhaps not. I believe there were some mis-

not quite just to Mr. Edward ; and, perhaps, he prejudiced
his father against him. The old gentleman was fond of
money, and anxious to keep the family estate together. He
did not Uke to diminish the property by division, and yet he

For several subsequent days I saw litUe of Mr. Boohester.
In the mornings he seemed much engaged with business,
and in the afternoon gentlemen from Millcote or the neigh-
bourhood called, and sometimes stayed to dine with him.
When his sprain was well enough to admit of horse exereisay
he rode out a good deal ; probably to return these viats, as
he generally did not come back tiU late at night.
During this interval even AdUe was seldom sent for to
his presence, and all my acquaintance with him was confined
to an occasional rencontre in the hall, on the stairs, or in the
gallery, when he would sometimes pass me haughtily and
coldly, just acknowledging my presence by a distant nod or
a cool glance, and sometimes bow and smile with gentleman-
like affability. His changes of mood did not offend me.
because I saw that I had nothing to do with their alternation ;
the ebb and flow depended on causes quite disconnected
with me.
One day he had had company to dinner, and had sent
for my portfolio ; in order, doubtless, to exhibit its contents.
The gentlemen went away early, to attend a public meeting
at Millcote, as Mrs. Fairfax informed me ; but the night
being wet and inclement, Mr. Rochester did not accompany
them. Soon after they were gone, he rang the bell: a
message came that I and Ad61e were to go downstairs. I
brushed Ad61e's hair and made her neat, and having ascer-
tained that I was myself in my usual Quaker trim, where
there was nothing to retouch — all being too close and plain,
braided locks included, to admit of disarrangement — ^we

'Good-evening, madam ; I sent to yoa for a charitable
purpose : I have forbidden AdMe to talk to me about her
presents, and she is bursting with repletion ; have the good*
ness to serve her as auditress and interlocutrice : it will be
one of the most benevolent acts you ever performed*'
AdMe, indeed, no sooner saw Mrs. Eiairfax than she
summoned her to the sofa, and there quickly filled her lap
with the porcelain, the ivory, the waxen contente of h^
'bolte'; pouring out, meantime, explanations and raptures
in such broken English as she was mistress of.

Mr. Rochester,'put my guests into the way of amusing

pleasure. . Miss Eyre, draw your chair still a little further

I did as I was bid, though I would much rather havo
remained somewhat in the shade : but Mr. Rochester had
such a direct way of giving orders, it seemed a matter of
course to obey him promptly.
We were, as I have said, in the dining-room : the lustre,
which had been lit for dinner, filled the room with a festal
breadth of light ; the large fire was all red and dear ; the
purple curtains hung rich and ample before the lofty window
and loftier arch ; ever}^hing was still, save the subdued
chat of Ad6le (she dared not speak loud), and, filling up
each pause, the beating of winter rain against the panes.
Mr. Rochester, as he sat in his damask-covered chaiTp
looked dififerent to what I had se3n him look before; not
quite so stem — much less gloomy. There was a smile on
his lips, and his eyes sparkled, whether with wine or not I
am not sure ; but I think it very probable. He was, in
short, in his after-dinner mood ; more expanded and genial,
and also more self-indulgent than the frigid and rigid
temper of the morning : still he looked preciously grim.

hewn features, and in his great, dark eyea ; for he had great,
dark eyes, and very fine eyes too — not without a certain
change in their depths sometimes, which, if it was not soft-
ness, reminded you, at least, of that feeling.
He had been looking two minutes at the fire, and I
had been looking the same length of time at him, when
turning suddenly, he caught my gaze fastened on his
physiognomy.
'You examine me, Miss Eyre,'said he ;'do you think
me handsome 7'
I should, if I bad deliberated, have replied to this
question by something conventionally vague and poUte ; but
the answer somehow sUpped from my tongue before I waa
aware : —'No, sir.'
'Ah ! By my word I there is something singular about
you,'said he :'you have the air of a little nonnette ; quaint,
quiet, grave, and simple, as you sit with your hands befon
you, and your eyes generally bent on the carpet (except, by-
the-bye, when they are directed piercingly to my face ; m
just now, for instanoe) ; and when one a^s you a qaeslJOD,
or makes a remark to which you are obliged to reply, you
rap out ft round rejoinder, which, if not blunt, is at least
brasque. What do you mean by it 7'
'Sir, I was too pliun : I beg your pardon. I ought to
have replied that it was not easy to give an impromptu
answer to a question about appearances ; that tastes differ ;
that beauty is of little consequenca, at something of that
•ort'
'You ought to have replied no such thing. Beauty of
little consequence, indeed 1 And so, under pretence of
softening the previous outrage, of stroking and soothing mo
into placidity, yon stick a sly penknife under my ear 1 Go
on : what fault do you find with me, pray 7 I suppose I

He lifted up the sable waves of hair which lay horizont-
ally over his brow, and showed a solid enough mass ot
iutcllectual organs, but an abrupt deficiency where the soava
sign of benevolence should have risen. 3 ^ -'*
'Now, ma'am, am I a fod?'
'Far from it, sir. You would, perhaps, think me rade if
I inquired in return whether you are a philanthropist?'
'. There again ! Another stick of the penknife, when she
pretended to pat my head : and that is because I said I did
not like the society of children and old women (low be it
spoken 1). No, young lady, I am not a general philan-
thropist ; but I bear a conscience ;'and he pointed to the
prominences which are said to indicate that faculty, and
which, fortunately for him, were sufficiently oonspicuoos;
giving, indeed, a marked breadth to the upper part of his
head :'and, besides, I once had a kind of rude tenderness
of heart. When I was as old as you I was a feeling fellow
enough ; partial to the unfledged, unfostered, and unlucky ;
but fortune has knocked me about since : she has even
kneaded me with her knuckles, and now I flatter myself I
am hard and tough as an India-rubber ball; pervious,
though, through a chink or two still, and with one sentient
point in the middle of the lump. Yes : does that leave hope
for me ? *
* Hope of what, sir?'
'Of my final re-transformation from India-rubber back
to flesh ? •
'Decidedly he has had too much wine,'I thought ; and I
did not know what answer to make to his queer question : how
could I tell whether he was capable of being re-transformed?
'You look very much puzzled, Miss Eyre ; and though you
are not pretty any more than I am handsome, yet a puzded air
becomes you; besides, it is convenient, for it keeps those
searching eyes of yours away from my physiognomy, and
busies them with the worsted flowers of the rug ; so puzzle

With diis aanotiDceinent be rose [rom bis chair, and
stood, kaniag bis ami on the maible mantelpiece ; in that
attitude bis shape was seen plainly as well as his faee ; his
unusual breadth of chest, dispraporticHiate almi^t to bis

or adventitious, to atone for the lack of mere personal attrac-

indifference, and. e^'en in a blind, imperfect sense, pat futb

'I am ^sposed to be gregarious and eommunicattre to-

Instead of speaking, I smiled ; and not a very complacent
or submissive smile uther.

'Whatever you like. I leave both tbe choice of subject

'You are damb, Miss Eyre.'
I was dumb still. He bent his head a litde towards me,
and with a single hasty glance seemed to dive into my eyes.
'Stubborn ?'he said,'and annoyed. Ah, it is consistent. I
put my request in an absurd, almost insolent form. Miss IRyre,
I beg your pardon. The fact is, once for all, I don't wish to
treat you like an inferior : that is (correcting himself), I claim
only such superiority as must result from twenty years*
difference in age and a century's advance in experience.
This is legitimate, et j'y tiens, as Ad61e would say ; and it is
by virtue of this superiority and this alone that I desire
you to have the goodness to talk to me a little now, and
divert my thoughts, which are galled with dwelling on one
point — cankering as a rusty naiL'
He had deigned an explanation ; almost an apology : I
did not feel insensible to his condescension, and would not
seem so.
'I am willing to amuse you if I can, sir : quite willing ;
but I cannot introduce a topic, because how do I know what
will interest you 7f Ask me questions, and I will do my best
to answer them.'
'Then, in the first place, do you agree with me that I
have a right to be a little masterful, abrupt ; perhaps ex-
acting, sometimes, on the groimds I stated ; namely, that I
am old enough to be yoiur father, and that I have battled
through a varied experience with many men of many nations,
and roamed over half the globe, while you have lived quietly
with one set of people in one house ?'
< Do as you please, sir.'
'That is no answer ; or rather it is a very irritating,
because a very evasive one ; reply clearly.'
'I don't think, sir, you have a right to command ma
merely because you are older than I, or because yon have
seen more of the world than I have ; your claim to superiority
depends on the use you have made of your time and ex-'.
perience.*

seeing that it would never auit ray case ; as I bave made
an indiSereot, not to sa; a bail, use of both advantages.
Ijeaving superioritj out of tbe question, then, you must
Btill agree to receive mj orders uow and then, without being
piqued or hart by the tone of command — will you ?'
I smiled : I thought to myself Mr. Rochester is peculiar
—rhe seems to forget that he pays me 30J. per annum for
receiving his orders.
'The smile is very well,'said he, catching instantly tbe
passing expression ;'but speak too.'
'I was thinking, sir, that very few masters would trouble
themselves to inquire whether or not their paid subordinates
were piqued and hurt by thdr orders.'
'Paid subordinates I What, you ore my paid subordinate,
are you? Oh, yes, I had forgotten the salary t Well, then,
on that mercenary ground, will you agree to let me hector a
Uttle?'
'No, sir, not on that ground : but, on the ground that
yon did forget it, and that you care whether or not ft depen-
dent is comfortable in his dependency, I agree heartily.'
'And will you consent to dispense with a great many
conventional forms and phrases, without thinking that tbe
omission arises from insolence?'
'I am sure) sir, I should never mistake informality for
insolence: one I rather like, the other nothing free-bom
would submit to, even for a salary.'
'Humbug I Most things free-bom will submit to any-
thing for a salary ; therefore, keep to yourself, and don't
venture on generalities of which you are intensely ignorant
However, I mentally shake hands with you for your answer,
despite its inaccuracy ; and as much for the manner in which
it was said as for the substance of the speech : the manner
was frank and sincere ; one does not often see such a manner :
no, on the contrary, affectation, or coldness, or stupid, coarse-
minded misapprehension of one's meaning are the usual
rewards ot candour. Not three in three thousand raw school-

different mould to the majority, it is no merit of yours :
Nature did it. And then, after all, I go too fast in my con-
clusions : for what I yet know, you may be no beUer than
the rest ; you may have intolerable defects to counterbalanoe
your few good points-'
'And so may you,'I thought My eye met his as the
idea crossed my mind : he seemed to read the glance, answer-
ing as if its import had been spoken as well as imagined : —
'Yes, yes, you are right,'said he ;'I have plenty of faults
of my own : I know it, and I don't wish to palliate them, I
assure you. God wot I need not be too severe about others ;
I have a past existence, a series of deeds, a colour of life to
contemplate within my own breast, which might well call
my sneers and censures from my neighbours to myself. I
started, or rather (for, like other defaulters, I like to lay
half the blame on ill fortune and adverse circumstances)

by-the-bye, what you express with that organ, I am quick at
interpreting its language). Then take my word for it,— I am

manifestations.'

as if I were writing my thoughts in a diary. Xou would
say, I should have been superior to circumstances ; so

to confess that he and I are on a level. I wish I had stood

extended, on his chest, he seemed to enclose in their embrace

find it possible to become what you yourself would approve ;
and that if from this day yon began with resolution to

'And better — so much better as pore ore is than foul

'In that sense I do feel apprehensive — ^I have no wish to
talk nonsense.'
'If you did, it would be in such a grave, quiet manner, I

Don't trouble yourself to answer — I see, you laugh rarely ;
but you can laugh very merrily: believe me, you are nol
naturally austere, any more than I am naturally vicious.
The Lowood constraint still clings to you somewhat; con-
trolling yoiur features, mufSing your voice, and restricting
your limbs ; and you fear in the presence of a man and a
brother — or father, or master, or what you will — to smile too
gaily, speak too freely, or move too quickly : but, in time, I
think you will learn to be natural with me, as I find it
impossible to be conventional with you ; and then your looks
and movements will have more vivacity and variety than
they dare offer now. I see at intervals the glance of a

CHAPTEB XV
Mr. Bochesteb did, on ft future occasion, eiplun it.
It was one afternoon, when he ch & nced to meet me and
Adile in the grounds ; and while she played with Pilot and
her shuttlecock, he asked me to walk up and down a long
beech avenue within sight of her.
He then said that she was the daughter of a French opera-
j dancer, C^ne Varens, towards whom he had once cherished
what he called a'giande passion.'This passion Cihne bad
professed to return with even superior ardour. He thought'
himself her idol ; ugly as be was : he believed, as he said,
that she preferred his'taille d'athUle'to the elegance of the
Apollo Bel V id ere.
'And, Miss Eyre, so much was I flattered by this pre-
ference of the Gallic sylph for her British gnome, that I
installed her in on hotel ; gave her a complete estfthlisbment
of servants, a carriage, cashmeres, diamonds, dentelles, Ac.
In short, I began the processof raining myself in the received
jtyle, like any other spoony. I had not, it seems, the
originality to chalk out a new road to shame and destruction,
but trod the old track with stupid exactness not to deviate an
inch from the beaten centre. I hod — as I deserved to have —
the fate of all other spoonies. Happening to call one evening
when Celine did not eipect me, I found her out ; but it was
ft warm night, and I was tired with strolling through Paris,
to I sat down in her boudoir; happy to breathe the ur

Here ensued a pause, filled up by the producing and
ghting of a cigar ; having placed it to his lips and breathed
trail of Havannah incense on the freezing and sunless air,

and struck his boot against the hard ground. Some hated
thought seemed to have him In its grip, and to hold him so
ti^tly that he could not advance.
We were ascending the avenue when he thus paused ;
tha hall was before us. lifting his eye to its battlements, be
cast over them a glare such as I never saw before or since.
Pain, shame, ire — impaUence, disgust, detestation — seemed
momentarily to hold a quivering conflict in the large pupil
~^ dilating under his ebon eyebrow. Wild was the wrestle which
■hould be paramount; but another feeling rose and tri-
umphed : something hard and cynical ; self-willed and
resolute : it settled his passion and petrified hie countenance :
he went on : —'During the moment I was silent, Miss Eyre,

On the table, and withdrew. The couple were thus revealed
io me clearly: both removed their cloaks, and there was
" the Varens " shining in satin and jewels, — my gifts o(
course, — and there was her companion in an officer's uniform ;
«Dd I knew him for a young roud of a vicomte — a brainless
KDd vicious youth whom I had sometimes met in society,
»nd had never thought of hadag because I despised him so
absolutely. On recognising him, the fang of the snake,
jealousy, was instantly broken ; because at the same
moment my love for Cdline sank under an extinguisher. A
woman who could betray me for such a iival was not worth
contending for: she deserved only scorn; less, however,

'Ah 1 in that case I must abridge. Opening the window,

protestations, convulsions; made an appointment wiih the
vicomte for a meeting at the Bois de Boulogne. Next
morning I had the pleasure of encountering him ; left a
bullet in one of his poor etiolated arms, feeble as the wing of
a chicken in the pip, and then thought I had done with the
whole crew. But unluckily the Yarens, six months before,
had given me this filette Ad61e ; who she afiSrmed was my
daughter; and perhaps she may be, though I see no
proofs of such grim paternity, written in her oounten & nce.
Pilot is more Uke me than she. Some years after I had
broken with the mother she abandoned her child and ran
away to Italy with a musician or singer. I acknowledged
no natural claim on Ad & le's part to be supported by me ; not
do I now acknowledge any, for I am not her father; but
hearing that she was quite destitute, I e'en took the poor
thing out of the slime and mud of Paris, and transplanted it
here, to grow up clean in the wholesome soil of an English
country garden. Mrs. Fairfax found you to train it; but
now you know that it is the illegitimate ofifspring of a F^renoh
opera-girl, you will perhaps think differently of your post
and protdg6e. You will be coming to me some day with
notice that you have found another place — that yoa beg me
to look out for a new governess, & o. — eh ?'
'No. Ad61e b not answerable for either her mother's
faults or yours. I have a regard for her, and now that I
know she is, in a sense, parentless — forsaken by her mother
and disowned by you, sir — I shall cling closer to her than
before. How could I possibly prefer the spoilt pet of a
wealthy family, who would hate her governess as a nuisanoe,
to a lonely little orphan, who leans towards her as a
friend?'

'Ob, tliat is tba light in which 700 view It I Well, I
must go in now ; and you too : it darkens.'
But I stayed out a few minutes looger with Ad & le luid
Pilot — ran a race with her, and played a game of battledore
uid shuttlecock. When we went in, and I had removed her
bonnet and coat, I took her on my knee ; kept her there an
hour, allowing her to prattle as she liked, not rebuking even
Bome little freedoms and triviaUties into which she was apt
to stray when much noticed ; and which betrayed in her a
BUperficiaUty of character, inherited probably from her
mother, hardly congenial to an Enghsh mind. Still she had
ber merits ; and I was disposed to appreciate all that was
good in her to the utmost. I sought in ber countenance
and features a likeness to Mr. Hochester, but fouod none —
DO trait, DO turn of expression announced relationship. It
was a pity : if she could but have been proved to resemble
him, ha would have thought more of her.
It was not till after I had withdrawn to my own
chamber for the night that I Btcadily reviewed the tale
Mr. Hochester had told me. As be ha,d said, there was
probably nothing at all extraordinary in the substance of the
n & rrxtiye itself — a wealthy Enghshman's passion for a
French dancer, and her treachery to him, were everyday
matters enough, no doubt, in society — but there was some-
thing decidedly strange in the paroxysm of emotion which
had suddenly seized him, when he was in the act of
expressing the present contentment of his mood, and his
newly-revived pleasure in the old hall and its environs. I
meditated wouderingly on this incident: but graduallv
qoitting it, as I found it for the present inexplicable, I turned
to the consideration of my master's manner to myself. The
confidence he had thought fit to repose in me seemed a
tribute to my discretion. I regarded and accepted it as
such. His deportment had now for some weeks been more
anifonn towards me than at the fiisL I never seemed in
his way ; he did not lake fits of obiUiog hauteur ; when he
met me anexpectedly, the encounter seemed welcome — he

All at onoe I remembered ihaA it might be Pilot: wbo,
when the kitchen-door chanced to be left open, not miice-
quendy found his way up to the threshold of Mr. Bochester^s
chamber : I had seen him lying there myself, in the momingi.
The idea calmed me somewhat : I lay down. Silence com-
poses the nerves; and as an anbroken hush now reigned
again through the whole house, I began to feel the return d
slumber. But it was not fated that I should sleep thai
nighi A dream had scarcely approached my ear, when it
fled afifrighted, scared by a marrow-freezing incident enongh.
This was a demoniac laugh — ^low, suppressed, and dee^— %
uttered, as it seemed, at the very key-hole of my chamber-
door. The head of my bed was near the door, and I thon^
at first the goblin-laugher stood at my bedside — or ratW,
crouched by my pillow : but I rose, looked round, and ooold
see nothing ; while, as I still gazed, the unnatural sound
was reiterated : and I knew it came from behind the panels.
My first impulse was to rise and fasten the bolt ; my next
again, to cry out,'Who is there? *
Something gurgled and moaned. Ere long, steps
retreated up the gallery towards the third story staircase : a
door had lately been made to shut in that staircase ; I heard
it open and close, and all was stilL
'Was that Grace Poole? and is she possessed with a
devil?'thought I. Impossible now to remain longer by
myself : I must go to Mrs. Fairfax. I hurried on my frock
and a shawl ; I withdrew the bolt, and opened the door with
a trembling hand. There was a candle burning just outsida,
left on the matting in the gallery. I was surprised at this
circumstance : but still more was I amazed to perceive
the air quite dim, as if filled with smoke ; and, while locdc-
ing to the right hand and left, to find whence these bine
wreaths issued, I became further aware of a strong smell of
burning.
Something creaked : it was a door ajar ; and that door
was Mr. Rochester's, and the smoke rushed in a cloud from
thence. I thought no more of Mrs. Eairtax ; I thought no

snrveyed the bed, all blackened and soorohed, the sheets
drenched, the caqpet round swimming in water.
'What is it? and who did it?'he asked.
I briefly related to him what had transpied: the stnuige
laugh I had heard in the gallery : the step ag^oending to the
third story ; the smoke, — the smell of fire which had cod-
ducted me to his room ; in what state I had foond matters
there, and how I had delnged him with all the water I oonld
lay hands on.
He listened very gravely ; his face, as ^ went on, ex*
pressed more concern than astomshment ; he did not im*
mediately speak when I had concluded.
* Shall I call Mrs. Fairfax?'I asked.
* Mrs. Fairfax ? No : what the deuce would you call her
for ? What can she do ? Let her sleep unmolested.'
'Then I will fetch Leah, and wake John and his wife.'
'Not at all : just be stilL You have a shawl on? liyoa
are not warm enough, you may take my cloak yonder; wrap
it about you, and sit down in the arm-chair : there, — ^I will
put it on. Now place your feet on the stool, to keep them
out of the wet. I am going to leave you a few minutes. I
shall take the candle. Bemain where you are till I return :
be as still as a mouse. I must pay a visit to the third story.
Don't move, remember, or call any one.'
He went : I watched the light withdraw. He passed up
the gallery very softly, unclosed the staircase door with as
little noise as possible, shut it after him, and the last ray
vanished. I was left in total darkness. I listened for some
noise, but heard nothing. A very long time elapsed. I
grew weary : it was cold, in spite of the cloak ; and then I
did not see the use of staying, as I was not to rouse the
house. I was on the point of risking Mr. Bochester^s dis-
pleasure, by disobeying his orders, when the light once moiB
gleamed dimly on the gallery-wall, and I hefurd his unshod
feet tread the matting.'I hope it is he,'thought I,'and
not something worse.'
He re-entered, pale and very gloomy.'I have found it

'il is Ets I thought'
'How, sir ?'
He made no reply, bat stood with his arms folded, look-
ing on the ground. At the end of a few minutes, he ioquired
in rather a pecuhar tooe : — ■'I forget whether you said you
saw anything when you opened your chamber door.'
'No, sir, only the candlestick on the ground.'
'But you heard an odd laugh 7 You have heard that
laugh before, I should think, or something like It 7'
'Yes, sir : there is a woman who sews here, called Grace
Foole — she laughs in that way. She is a singular person.'
'Just so. Grace Foole — you have guessed it. She ia, as
yon say, singular, — very. Well, I shall reflect on the subject.
UeantJme, I am glad that you are the only person, besides
myself, acquainted with the precise details of to-night's inci-
dent. You are no talking fool : say nothing about it. I will
account for this state of affaire (pointing to the bed) : and
DOW return to your own room. I shall do very well on the
■ofa in die library for the rest of the night. It is near

'Good-night, then, sir,'said I, departing.
He seemed aurpiised — very inconsistently so, as he had
just told ma to go.
'What 1'he exolalmed,'are yoa quitting me already :

'Yoa said I might go, air.'

He held out his hand ; I gave him mine : he took it first
in one, then in both his own.

CHAPTEB XVI
[ I BOTH wished and feared to see Mr. Bochester od the d & y
which foltowed this sleepless night. I wanted to hear his
voice ag & in, yet feared to meet his eye. During the early
part of the morning, I momentarily expected his coming.
He was not in the frequent habit of entering the school-
room : but he did step in for a few minutes aometimea, and
I had the impression that he wag sura to visib it that day.
But the morning passed just as usual. Nothing happened
to ioterrupt the quiet course of Ad61e's studies ; only, soon
^ter breakfast, I beard some bustle in the neighbourhood of
Ur. Bochester's chamber, Mrs. Fairfax's voice, and Leoh'a,
and the cook's — that is, John's wife — and even John's own
gruff tones. There were exclamations of,'What a mercy
master was aot burnt in his bed I''It is always dangerous
to keep a candl« lit at night.''How providential that be
bad presence of mind to tbink of the water- jug I''I

To much confabulation succeedeid a sound of scrubbing
and setting to-rights ; and when I passed the room, in going
downstairs to dinner, I saw through the open door that all
was agun restored to complete order — only the bed was
stripped o( its hangings. Leah stood up in the window-seat,
rubbing the panes of glass dimmed with smoke. I was
about to address her, for I wished to know what account
had been given of the affair ; but, on advancing, I saw a
tecond person in the chamber — a woman sitting on a chair
'by the bedside, and sewing rings to new ourtains. That
woman wa« do other than Grace Foole.
uh*

JANB BYBB ^ 183
There she sat, staid and laoitum-looking, as usoal, in her
brown stuff gown, her check apron, white handkerchief, and
cap. She was intent on her work, in which her whole
thoughts seemed absorbed. On her hard forehead, and in her
commonplace features, was nothing either of the paleness or
desperation one would have expected to see marking the
countenance of a woman who had attempted murder, and
whose intended victim had followed her last night to her lair,
and (as I believed) charged her with the crime she wished
to perpetrate. I was amazed — confounded. She looked np^
while I still gazed at her : no start, no increase or failure of
colour betrayed emotion, consciousness of guilt, or fear of
detection. She said,'Qood morning, Miss,'in her usual
phlegmatic and brief manner ; and taking up another ring
and more tap9| ^?ent on with her sewing.
'I will put her to some test,'thought I.'Such absc^ta
impenetrability is past comprehension.'
'Good morning, Qrace,'I said. * Has anything happened
here ? I thought I heard the servants all talking together a
while ago.'
* Only master had been reading in his bed last ni^t.
He fell asleep with his candle lit, and the curtains got on
fire ; but, fortunately, he awoke before the bed-clothes or the ^
wood- work caught, and contrived to quench the flame with
the water in the ewer.'. f
'A strange affair 1'I said, in a low voice ; then, looking ;
at her fixedly,'Did Mr. Rochester wake nobody ? Did no
one hear him move ?'
She again raised her eyes to me ; and this time there was ^
something of consciousness in their expression. She seemed
to examine me warily ; then she answered,'The servants
sleep 80 far off, you know. Miss, they would not be likely to
hear. Mrs. Fairfax's room and yomrs are the nearest to
master's ; but Mrs. Fairfax said she heard nothing : when
people get elderly, they often sleep heavy.'She paused, and
then added, with a sort of assumed indifference, but still in
a marked and significant tone,'But you are young. Miss,
■'~i

sleeper. Perhaps you may have
heard a noise 7'
'I did, " said I, dropping my voice, so that Leah, who was
still polishing the panes, could not hear me,'and at first I
thought it was Pilot ; but Pilot canoot laugh, and I am certain
I heard a laugh, and a strange one.'
She book a new needleful of thread, waxed it carefully,
threaded her needle with a steady hand, and then ohserved,
with perfect composure,—'It is hardly likely mael«r would
laugh, I should think, \fiss, when he was in such danger:
you most have been draaming.'
'I was nob dreaming,'I said, wiUi some warmth, for her
brazen coolness provoked me. Again she looked at me, and
with the same scrutinising and conscious eye.
'Have you told master thai yon heard a laugh ?'she
inqoited.
'I have not had the opportam^ of speaking to turn this
morning.'
'You did not think of opening your door and looking out
into the gallery? " she further asked.
She appeared to be cross-questioning me — attempting to
draw from me information unawares. The idea struck me
that if she discovered I knew or suspected her guilt, she
would be playing off eome of her maUgnant pranks on me.
I thought it advisable to be on my guard.
'On the contrary,'said I,'I bdted my door.'
'Then you are not in the habit of bolting your door every
night before you get into bed 7'
'Fiend 1 she wants to know my habits, that she may lay
her plans accordingly !'Indigna^on again prevailed over
prudence ; I replied shatply,'Hitherto I hare often omitted
to fasten the bolt : I did not think it necessary. I was not
aware any danger or annoyance was to be dreaded at
Thomfield Hall ; but in future " (and I laid marked stress on
the words)'I shall take good care to make all secore before
I venture to lie down.'
'It will be wise so to do,'was her answer.'This

neighbourhood is as quiet as any I Imow, and I never heard
o! the hall being attempted by robbers since it was a house
though there are hundreds of pounds'worth of plate in the
plate-closet, as is well known. And you see, for such a large
house, there are very few servants, because master has never
lived here much, and when he does come, b^ng a bachelor,
he needs little waiting on ; but I alwajrs think it best to err
on the safe side : a door is soon fastened, and it is as well to'
have a drawn bolt between one and any mischief that may
be about. A deal of people, Miss, are for trusting all to
Providence ; but I say Providence will not dispense with the
means, though He often blesses them when they are used
discreetly.'And here she closed her harangue : a long one
for her, and uttered with the demureness of a Quakeress.
I still stood absolutely dumfoundered at what appeared
to me her miraculous seU-possession and most inscrutable
h}'pocri8y, when the cook entered.
'Mrs. Poole,'said she, addressing Grace,'the servants*
dinner wiU soon be ready. Will you come down?'
'No. Just put my pint of porter and bit of pudding on
a tray, and I'll carry it upstairs.'
'You'll have some meat ?'
'Just a morsel, and a taste of cheese, that's alL*
'And the sago?'
'Never mind it at present. I shall be coming down before
tea-time. I'll make it myself.'
The cook here turned to me, saying that Mrs. Fairfax waa
waiting for me : so I departed.
I hardly heard Mrs. Fairfax's account of the curtain
conflagration during dinner, so much was I occupied in
puzzling my brains over the enigmatical character of Graoe
Poole, and still more in pondering the problem of her position
at Thornfield ; in questioning why she had not been given
into custody that morning, or, at the very least, dismissed
from her master's service. He had almost as much as declared
his conviction of her criminality last night : what mysterious
aause withheld him from accusing her ? Why had he enjoi)

'It 13 fair to-night,'sa.id she, as she looked through the

gone to the Leas, Mr. Eshton's place, ten miles on the other

others.'
'Do yoa ezpeot'him back to-night ?'
'No — nor to-morrow either ; I should think he is very
likely to stay a week or more. When these fine, fashionabto
people get together, they are so surrounded by elegance and
guety, so well provided with all that can please and entertun,
they are in no hurry to separate. Gentlemen, especially, are
often in request on such occasions ; and Mr. Bochester U so

talented and so lively in sooiety^ihai I believe be is a general
favourite— the ladies are very fond of bim — fhongb yoa
would not think his appearance calculated to recommend him
particularly in their eyes ; but I suppose bis acquirements
and abilities, perhaps his wealth and good blood, maike
amends for any little fault of look.*
'Are there ladies at the Leas ?'
• There are Mrs. Eshton and her three daughters — ^veiy
elegant young ladies, indeed ; and there are the Honourable .
Blanche and Mary Ingram — most beautiful women, I sup-'
pose : indeed, I have seen Blanche, six or seven years since,
when she was a girl of eighteen. She came here to a Christ-
mas ball and party Mr. Rochester gave. Tou should have .
seen the dining-room that day — ^how richly it was decorated,
how brilliantly lit up I I should think there were fifty ladies
and gentlemen present — all of the first county families ; and
Miss Ingram was considered the belle of the evening.*'
*7ou saw ber, you say, Mrs. Fairfax: what was she
like?'
'Tes, I saw her. The dining-room doors were thzowii
open, and, as it was Christmas-time, the servants were
allowed to assemble in the hall, to hear some of the ladies
sing and play. Mr. Bochester would have me to come in,
and I sat down in a quiet comer and watched theoL I
never saw a more splendid scene : the ladies were magnifi*
cently dressed ; most of them — at least most of the younger
ones— looked handsome, but Miss Ingram was certainly th6
queen.'
'And what was she like?*
'Tall, fine bust, sloping shoulders, long, graceful neck ;
olive complexion, dark and dear; noUe features; eyes
rather like Mr. Bochester's, large and black, and as brilliant
as her jewels. And then she had such a fine head of hair,
raven-black, and so becomingly arranged ; a crown of thick
plaits behind, and in front the longest, th6 glossiest curls I
ever saw. She was dressed in pure white, an amber-coloured
scarf was passed over her shoulder and across her breast» tied

it oontrasted well with the jetty mass of her curls.'
'She WEis greatly admired, of coorae 7'
'Yea, indeed, and not only for ber beauty, but for her
accomplishments. She was one of the ladies who sang ; a
gentleman accompanied her on the piano. She and Mr.
Bochest«r sang a duet.'
'Mr. Rochester? I was not aware he could sing.'
'Oh 1 he has a fine bass voice, and an excellent taste for
musie.'
* And Miss Ing^^un, what sOrt of a voice had she 7'
•A very rich and powerful one— she sang delightfully —
it was & treat to listen to her ; and she played afterwards.
I am DO judge of music, but Mr. Bochester is, and I heard
him say her execution was remarkably good.'
'And this beautiful and aocomplisbed lady is not yet
married?'
'It appearg not : I fancy nuther she nor her sister bavs
very large lortnnes. Old £x > rd Ingram's estates were chiefly
ent^ed, and the eldest son come in for everything almost.'
'But I wonder no wealthy nobleman or gentleman has
taien a fancy to her : Mr. Boohester, tor instance. He is
rich, is he not ?'
'Oh 1 yes. But you see there is a considerable difference
in age : Mr. Bochester is near forty ; she is but twenty-five.'
'What of that? More unequal matches are made every
day.'
'True : yet I should scarcely fancy Mr. Bochester would
entertUD an idea of the sort. But you eat nothing : yon
have scarcely tasted since you began tea.'
'Ho : I am too thirsty to eat Will you let ma have
another eop?'
I was abont again to revert to the probability of a anion

When once more alone, I reviewed the infommfion
had got; looked into my heart, examined its though
and feelings, and endeavoured to bring back with a 8iri(
hand such as had been straying through imaguiation'
boundless and trackless waste, into the safe fold ct comm
sense.
Arraigned at my own bar. Memory having given her
evidence of the hopes, wishes, sentiments I had been cherish-
ing since last night— of the general state of mind in which I
had indulged for nearly a fortnight past ; Beason having come
forward and told in her own quiet way, a plain, unvarnished
tale, showing how I had rejected the real, and rabidly
devoured the ideal ; — I pronounced judgment to this effidot : —
That a greater fool than Jane Eyre had never breathed the
breath of life : that a more fantastic idiot had never surfnted
herself on sweet lies, and swallowed poison as if it were
nectar.
'YoUt* I said,'a favourite with Mr. Bochester? Tim
gifted with the power of pleasing him ? You of importanoa
to him in any way? Go I your folly sickens me. And yoa
have derived pleasure from occasional tokens of preference —
equivocal tokens, shown by a gentleman of family, and a
man of the world, to a dependant and a novice. How dared
you ? Poor stupid dupe I — Gould not even self-interest make
you wiser ? You repeated to yourself this morning the brief
scene of last night? — Cover your face and be ashamed I
He said something in praise of your eyes, did he ? Blind
puppy! Open their bleared lids and look on your own
accursed senselessness I It does good to no woman to be
flattered by her superior, who cannot possibly intend to
marry her ; and it is madness in all women to let a secret
love kindle within them, which, if tmretumed and unknown,
must devour the life that feeds it; and, if discovered and
responded to, must lead, ^nis-/a(iiu«-like, into miry wflds,
whence there is no extrication.

picture, faithfully: without 6oft«iiing one defect: omit no
harah line, smooth away no displeasing irregularity ; write
under it, " Portrait of a Governess, disconnected, poor, and
plain. "
* Afterwards, take a piece of smooth ivory — you have one
prepared in your drawing-box : take your paletta, mix your
freshest, finest, clearest tints ; choose your most delicate
camel-hair pencils ; delineate carefully the loveliest face yon
can imagine; paint it in your softest shades and sweetest
hues, according to the description given by Mrs. Fairfax of
Blanche Ingram : remember the raven ringlets, the Oriental
eye ; — what ! you revert to Mr. Rochester as " a model I
Order I No snivel I — no sentiment 1— no regret 1 I will
endure only sense and resolution. Recall the august yet
harmonious lineaments, the Grecian neck and bust: let the
round and dazzling arm be visible, and the delicate hand;
onut neither diamond ring nor gold bmcelet ; portray faith-
fully the attire, aerial lace and glistening satin, graceful
scarf and golden rose : call it " Blanche, an accomplished
lady of rank. "
'Whenever, in future, you should chance to fancy Mr
Rochester thinks well of you, take out these two pictures
and compare them : eay, " Mr. Rochester might probabl
win that noble lady's love, it he chose to strive for it ; is
likely he would waste a serious thought on this indige
and insignificant plebeian ? "'
'I'll do it,'I resolved : and having framed this determii
tion, I grew calm, and tell asleep.
I kept my word. An hour or two sufficed to sketch
own portrait in crayons ; and in less than a fortnight I
O0m[deted an ivory miniature of an imaginary Blai
Ingram. It looked a lovely face enough, and when oomj
with the real head in chalk, the contrast was as great at
oontrot oonld desire. I derived benefit from the task : i
kept my head and hands employed, and had given fort
fixedness to the new impressions I wished to stamp i»
OD my heart.

A wsBK passed, and uo news arrirod of Mr. Boobester : ten
days, and still he ^d not come. Mra. Fairfax said she
sbould Dot be surprised if be -weie to go straight from the
Leas to Londoo, and tbeoca to the continent and not show
Iu3 face again at Thomfield for a year to come : he had not
onfrBquenlly quitted it in a manner quite as abrupt and
nnexpected. When I heard this I was beginning to feel a
strange chill and failing at the heart I was actually per-
mitting myself to experience a sickening sense of disappoint-
ment : but rallying my wits, and recollecting my principles, I
at once called my sensations to order ; and it was wonderful
how I got over the temporary blunder — how I cleared up the
mistake of supposing Mr. Bochester's movements a matter in
which I had any cause to take a vital interest^ Not that I
humbled myself by a sUvisb notion of inferiority ; on tiie
contrary, I just said —'Yoa have nothing to do with the
master ot Thomfield, further than to receive the salary he
gives you for teaching his protdg6e, and to be grateful tor such
respectful and kind treatment as, if you do your duty, you
have a right to expect at his hands. Be sure that is the only
tie he serioosly acknowledges between yon and him : so don't
make him the object of your fine feelings, your raptures,
ag(»ues, and so forth. He is not of your order : keep to your
caste, and be too self-respecting to lavish the love of the
whole heart, soul, and strength, where such a gift is not
wanted and would be despsed.'
I went on with my day's busineBB tranquilly, bnt ever
and anon vague suggestions kept wandering across my brain
of reasons why I should quit Thomfield ; and I kept In-

were got to help ; and sucb Ecrabbing, aoch brashiDg, sacli
washing of paint and beating of carpets, such taking down
and patting up of pictureB, such polishing of mirrors and
lustT«s, such lighting of fires in bedrooms, such airing of
sheets and feather-beds on hearths, I never beheld either
before or since. AdSIe ran quite wild in the midst of it : the
preparations for company, and the prospect ol their arrival,
seemed to throw her into ecstacies. She would have Sophie
to look over all her'toilettes/ as she called frocks ; to furbish
up any that were'pass^es,'and to air and arrange the new.
For herself, she did nothing but caper about in the front
chambers, jump on and off the bedsteads, and lie on the mat-
tresses and piled-up bobters and pillows before the enormous
fir«s roaring in the chimneys. From school duties she
was exonerated: Mrs. Fairfax had pressed me into hei
Krvice, and I was all day in the storeroom, helping (or
hindering her and the cook ; learning to make custards and
cheesecakes and French pastry, to truss game and garnish
dessert ^shes.
The party were expected to arrive on Thursday afternoon,
in time (or dinner at six. During the intervening period I
had no time to nurse chimeras ; and I believe I was as active
and gay as anybody — Ad^le excepted. Still, now and then,
I received a damping check to my cheerfulness ; and was. In
tpite of myself, thrown back on the region of doubts and
portents, and dark conjectures. This was when I chanced to
see the third story staircase door (which of late had always
been kept locked) open slowly, and give passage to the form
ot Grace Poole, in prim cap, whit« apron, and handkerchief ;
when I watched her glide along the gallery, her quiet tread
mntBed in a list slipper ; when I saw her look into the
bustling, topsy-turvy bedrooms, — just say a word, perhaps,
to the charwoman about the proper way to polish a grate, or
clean a marble mantelpiece, or take stains from papered
walls, and then pass on. She would thus descend to the
kitchen once a day, eat her dinner, smoke a moderate pipe
OD the hearth, and go back, carrying her pot of porter with

* Doesn't she Imow? * I heard the woman whisper.
Leah shook her head, and the conversation was of oonrsf^
iiropj > ed. All I had gathered from itamotmted to this, — thai
there was a mystery at Thomfield ; and that from participa-
tion in that mystery I was purposely excluded.

Thnrsday came ; all \TOrk bad been completed the previous
evening ; caxpets were laid down, bed-hangiDgs festooned,
radiant white conoterpanes spread, toilet-tabks arranged,
(urniture rubbed, flowers piled in vases : both chambers and
saJoona looked as fresh and bright as hands could make them.
The hall, too, was scoured ; and the great carved clock, as
well as the steps and banisters of the staircase, were pohahed
to the brightness of glass : in the dining-room, the sideboard
flashed resplendent with plate ; in the drawing-room and
boudoir, vases of exotics bloomed on all sides.
Afternoon arrived : Mrs. Fairfax assumed her best black
satin gown, her gloves, and her gold watch ; for it was her
part to receive the company — to conduct the ladies to their
rooms, & c. AdSle, too, would be dressed : though I thought
that she had little chance of being introduced to the party
that day, at least. However, to please her, I allowed Sophie
to apparel her in one of her short, full mushn frocks. For
myself, I had no need to moke any change ; I should not be
eaJled upon to quit my sanctum of the schoolroom ; for a
sanctum it was now become to me —'a very pleasant refuge
in time of tronble.'
Zt had been a mild, serene ^ring day ; one of those days
which, towards the end of March or the beginning of April,
rise shining over the earth as heralds of summer. It was
drawing to an end now; but the evening was even warm,
and I aat at work in the Bohoolroom vrith the window
open.
'It gate late,'siud Mrs. Furfax, entering in rustling state.
'I am ^ad I ordered dinner an hour after the time Mr.
Boohester mentioned ; for it is past dx now. I have sent
John down to the gates to see if there is anything on the
road : one can see a long way from thence in the direction
ot Millcote.'She went to the window.'Here he is I'sud
she.'Well, John'(leaning out),'any newa ?'
'They're coming, ma'am,'was the answer.'They'll be
here in ten minutes.'
AdUe flaw to the window. I followed ; taking oaie to

'Don't you feel hungry, Ad^le ?'
■ Mais ooi, mademoiselle : voiU cltiq ou ^x heores que
nous n'avons pas mangd.'
'Well now, while the ladies are in their rooms, I will
Tenture down and get you something to cat. "
And issuing from my asylum with precaution, I sought a
bftckslaira which conducted directly to the kitchen. AU in
that region was fire and commotion ; the soup and fish were
in the last stage of projection, and the cook hung over her
crucibles in a frame of mind and body threatening sponta- •
neons combustion. In the servants'hall two coachmen and
three gentlemen's gentlemen stood or sat round the fire ; the
Abigails, I suppose, were upstairs with their mistresses : the
new Beiranls that had been hired from Millcote were bustling
about everywhere. Threading this chaos, I at last reached
the larder ; there I took possession of a cold chicken, a roll
of broad, some tarts, a plate or two, and a knife and fork ;
with this booty I made a hasty retreat. I had regained the
gallery, and was just shutting the back-door behind me, when
an accelerated bum warned me that the ladies were about to
issue from their chambers. I could not proceed to the
schoolroom'without pasung some of their doora, and running
the risk ot being Burprised with my cargo of victnalage;
so I stood still at this end, which, being windowless, waa
dark : quite dark now, for the son was set and twilight
gathering. »
Presently the chambers gave up their fair tenants one
after another ; each oame out gaily and airily, with drees
that gleamed lustrous through the dusk. For a moment
they stood grouped together at the other extremity of die
gallery, convetsiog in a key of sweet subdued vivacity ; they
then descended the staircase almost as noiselessly as a bright
mist rolls down a hill. Their collective appearance had left
on me an impression of high-bom elegance, such as I had
never before received.

I {onnd Ad£l6 peepng through the schoohroom door,
which she held ajar.'What beautiful ladies I'eried she
in Eoglislu'Oh, I wish I might go to them 1 Do yoa
think Mr. Bochester will send tor us by-and-by, after
dinner?'
'No, indeed, I don't ; Mr. Boohester has something else
to think aboui Never mind the ladies to-nighi; perhaps
you will see them to-morrow ; here is your dinner.'
She. was really hungry, so the ohidcen and tarts served
to divert her attention for a time. It was well I secured
this forage; or both she, I and Sophie, to whom I eon-
vejed a share of our repast, would have run » chance
of getting no dinner at all: every one downstairs was
too much engaged to think of us. The dessert was nol
carried out till after nine ; and at ten footmen were still
running to and fro with trays and oofEde-cups. I allowed
Addle to rit up much later than usual; for she declared
she could not possibly go to sleep while the doors kept
opening and shutting below, and people bustling about.
Besides, she added, a message might possibly oome from
Mr. Bochester when she was undressed;'et alors quel
dommage I'
I told her stories as long as she would listen to them ;
and then for a change I took her out into the gallery. The
hall lamp was now lit, and it amused her to look over the
balustrade and watch the servants passing backwards and
forwards. When the evening was far advanced, a sound of
music issued from the drawing-room, whitheif the piano had
been removed. Addle and I sat down on the top step of the
stairs to listen. Presently a voice blent with Uie rich tones
of the instrument ; it was a lady who sang, and very sweet
her notes were. The solo over, a duet followed, and then »
glee : a joyous conversational murmur filled up the intervals.
I listened long: suddenly I discovered that my ear was
wholly intent on analysing the mingled sounds, and trying
to discriminate amidst the confusion of accents those ol
Mr. Bochester ; and when it caught them, which it soon did.

it Found a further task in framing thet!^ones, rendered b;
distance inarticulate, into words.
The cljck struck eleven. I looked at AdSle, whose head
leant against my shoulder; her eyes were waxing heavy,
so I took her up in my arms and carried her off to bed. It
was near one before tlia gentlemen and ladies sought their
ohambers.
The next day was as fine as its predecessor ; it was
devoted by the party to an ezcursioa to soma sight in the
Doighbourhood. They set out early in the forenoon, some
OD horseback, the rest in carriages ; I wituessed both the
departuia and the return. Miss Ingram, as before, was the
only lady eqnestrian ; and, as before, Mr. Bochester galloped
at her side ; the two rods a little apart from the rest I
pointed out this circumstance to Mrs. Fairfax, who was
Blaoding at the window vrith me :—
'You SEud it was not likely they should think of being
married,'said I,'but you see Mr. Bochester evidently
prefers her to any of the other ladies.'
'Yes ; I daresay : no doubt he admires her.'
* And she him,'I added ;'look how she leans ber bead
towards him aa if she were oonversing confidentially; I
wiab I oonld see ber faoe ; I have never had a glimpse of
it yet*
* Yon will see her this evening,'answered Mrs. Fairfax.
'I happened to remark to Mr. Bochester how much Addle
wished to be introduced to the ladies, and be said :'Oh 1 let
her come into the drawing-room after dinner ; and request
l£s8 Eyre to accompany ber.'
'Yea — ha scud that from mere politeness : I need not go,
I am sure,'I answered.
'Well. I observed to him that as yon were unused to
oompany, I did not think you would l^e appearing before
so gay a party — all strangers — and he replied, in his quick
way : " Nonsense 1 If she ohjects, tell her it is my particular
wish ; and if she resists, say I shall come and fetoh ber in

'I will not give him that trouble,'I answeied.'I will
go, if no better may be : bat I don't like it. ShaU yoa be
there, Mrs. Fairfax ?'
'No ; I pleaded off, and he admitted my plea. IH tdl
you how to manage so as to avoid the embarrassment of
making a formal entrance, which is the most disagreeable
part of the business. Yon must go into the drawing-room
while it is empty, before the ladies leave the dinner-table ;
choose your seat in any quiet nook you like ; you need no4
stay long after the gentlemen come in, unless you please :
just let Mr. Bochester see you are there and then slip away —
nobody will notice you.'
'Will these people remain long, do you think 7'
'Perhaps two or three weeks ; certainly not more. After
the Easter recess. Sir (reorge Lynn, who was lately eleoted
member for Millcote, will have to go up to town and take
his seat ; I daresay Mr. Bochester will accompany him : it
surprises me that he has already made so protracted a stay
at Thomfield.'
It was with some trepidation that I perceived the homr
approach when I was to repair with my charge to the draw-
ing-room. AdMe had been in a state of ecstasy all day, after
hearing she was to be presented to the ladies in the evening ;
and it was not till Sophie commenced the operation of dress-
ing her that she sobered down. Then the importance of tha
process quickly steadied her ; and by the time she had her
curls arranged in well-smoothed, drooping dusters, her pink
satin frock put on, her long sash tied, and her lace mittens
adjusted, she looked as grave as any judge. No need to warn
her not to disarrange her attire : when she was dressed, she
sat demurely down in her little chair, taking care previously
to lift up the satin skirt for fear she should crease it^ and
assured me she would not stir thence till I was ready. This
I quickly was ; my best dress (the silver-grey one, purchased
for Miss Temple's wedding, and never worn dnce) was soon
put on ; my hair was soon smoothed ; my sole ornament^
the pearl brooch, soon assumed. We descended.

Fortunately there waa another entranco to the drawing-
room thaD that through the saloon where they were all
seated at dinoer. We found the apartmeat vacant, a large
& ie burning silently on the marhle hearth, and wax candles
shining in bright sohtude, amid the exquisite fiowei's with
which Uie tahles were adorned. The cnmson curtain hung
before the arch : slight as was the separation this drapery
formed from the parly in the adjoining saloon, they spoke in
so low a key that nothing of their conversation could ha dia-
tinguisbed beyond a soothing murmur.
Ad^le, who appeared to be still under the induence of a
most solemnising impression, sat down, without a word, on
the footstool I pointed out to her. I retired to a window*
seat, and, taking a book from a table near, endeavoured to
read. Ad^le brought her stool to my feet ; ere long she
touched my knee.
'What is it, Ad61e ?'
■ Est-ce que je ne puis pas prendre one seule da ces fleurg
magniGques, mademoiselle ? Seulement pour completer ma
toilette.'
'You think too mnch of your " toilette, " AdSle, but you
may have a flower.'And I took a rose from a vase and
fastened it in her sash. She sighed a sigh of ioeffable
•atisfaotion, eis if her cup of happiness were now fulL I
turned my face away to conceal a smile I could not suppress :
there was something ludicrous as well as painful in the little
Parisienne's earnest and innate devotion to matters of dress.
A soft sound of ri^ng now became audible ; the curtain
was swept back from the arch ; through it appeared the
dining-room, with its lit lustre pouring down light on the
silver and glass of a magnificent dessert-service covering a
long table ; a band of ladies stood in the opening ; they
entered, and the cnrtain fell behind them.
There were but eight, yet somehow as tbey flocked in,
they gave the impregsion of a much larger number. Some of
them were very tall, many were dressed in white, and all bad a
sweeping amplitude ot array that seemed to magnify their

and BO she was, no doubt, pbysically speaking ; but then tbera
was an expression of almost insupportable baughtiness in
lier bearing and counteoanoe. She bad Boman features and
a doable obia, disappearing into a throat like a pillar : these
leatures appeared to me not only infiated aad darkened, but
even furrowed with pride ; and tbe obia wa.a sustained
b; tbe same principle, in a portion of atmoat preternatural
erectness. She bad, likewise, a fierce and a bard eye: it
reminded me of Mrs. Reed'B; abe mouthed ber words in
vpeaking ; her voice wa« deep, its inflections very pompous,
very dogmatical — very intolerable, in abort. A crimson
velvet robe, and a shawl turban of some gold-vrrought Indian
fabric, invested her (I suppose sbe thought) with a truly
imperial dignity.
Blanche and Mary were of equal stature— straight and
tall & B poplars. Mary was too slim for her height ; but
Blanche was moulded like a Dian. I regarded ber, of
course, with special interest, i^rst, I wished to see whether
. ber appearance accorded with Mrs. Fairfax's description;
fleoondly, whether it at all resembled tbe fancy miniature I had
painted of ber; and thirdly — it will out!— whether it were
Buoh as I should fancy likely to Bult Mr. Bochester's taste.
As far as person went, she answered point for point, both
to my picture and Mrs. Fairfax's desoriptaon. Tbe noble
bust, the sloping shoulders, the graceful neck, the dark eyes
and hlaok ringlets were all there — hat her face 7 Her face
was like her mother's ; a youthful unfurrowed likeness :
tiie same low brow, tbe same high featores, the same pride.
It was not, however, so satumino a pride : she laughed ood-
tinoally ; ber laugh was satirical, and bo was the habitual
expression of her arched and haughty lip.
Qenius is said to be self-conscious : I cannot tell whether
Miss Ingram was a geoias, but she was seU-oonscions —
remarkably self-conscious indeed. She entered into a dii-
course on botany with tbe gentle Mrs. Dent. It seems Mrs.
Dent bad not studied that science : though, as she said, she
liked flowcTB,'especially wild onei'; Miss Ingram had, and

And did I now think Miss Ingram snoh a eboioe as Ui
Bochester would be likely to make ? I oonld not tell — I &
not know his taste in female beaaty. If he liked the majestic
she was the very type of majesty : then she was aooom^shed

At last coffee is brought in, and the gentlemen are
Bommoned. I sit in the shade — if any shade there be in this
brilliantly -lit apartment ; the vriodow curtain halt hides me.
Again the arch yawns : they come. The ooUective appear*
knee of the gentlemen, like that of the ladies, is very
imposing : they ate all costumed in black ; most of them are
t & U, some young. Henry and Frederick Lynn are very
dashing sparks, indeed ; and Colonel Dent is a fine soldierly
Dian. Mr. Eshton, the niagistrate of the district, is gentle-
man-like : his hair is quite white, his eyebrows and whiskers
still dark, which gives him something of the appearance of a
'pire noble de thd & tre.'Lord Ingram, like his sisters, is
very tall ; like them, also, he is handsome ; but he shares
Mary's apathetic and hstless look : be seems to have more
length of bmb than vivacity of blood or vigour of brain.
And where is Mr. Bocbestei 7
He cornea in last : I am not looking at the arcb, yet I
see him enter. I try to concentrate my attention on those
netting- needles, on the meshes of the purse I ara forming— I
wish to think only of the work I have in my hands, to see
only tbe silver beadia and silk threads that lie in my lap ;
whereas, I distinctly behold his figure, and I inevitably recall
the moment when X last saw it : just after I had rendered
him, what he deemed an essential service-^and he, holding
my band, and looking down on my face, surveyed me with
eyes that revealed a heart full and eager to overflow ; in
whose emotions I had a part. How near had I approached
lum at that moment 1 What had occurred unce, calculated to
change his and my relative positions 7 Yet now, how distant,
how far estranged we were 1 So far estranged, that I did
not expeot him to come and speak to me. I did not wonder,
when, without looking at me, be took a seat at the other ude
of the room, and began oonverang with some of the ladiet.
No sooner did I see that his attention was riveted on
JANE BTSB
them, and that I might gaze without bong observed. th»^
my eyes were drawn involontarily to his taoe: I could nc'^
keep their lids under control : they would rise, and the iri^^
would fix on him« I looked, and had an acute pleasure 1^2
looking,— a precious, yet- poignant pleasure ; pure gdd, witiE^^
a steelly point of agony : a pleasure like what tiie thiist'^''^
perishing man might feel who knows the well to which heha^^
crept is poisoned, yet stoops and drinks divine draughts ^
nevertheless.
Most true is it that'beauty is in the eye of the gaier.'
My master's colourless, olive face, square, massive brow,
broad and jetty eyebrows, deep eyes, strong features, finn«
grim mouth, — all energy, decision^ wUl, — ^were not beautiful,
according to rule ; but diey were more than beautiful to me •
they were full of an interest, an influence that quite mastered
me, — that took my feelings from my own power and fettered
them in his. I had not intended to love him: the reader
knows I had wrought hard to extirpate from my soul the
germs of love there detected ; and now, at the first renewed
\new of him, they spontaneously revived, green and strong I
He made me love him without looking at me.
I compared him with his guests. . What was the gallant
grace of the Lynns, the languid elegance of Lord Ingram, —
even the military distinction of Colonel Dent, contrasted with
his look of native pith and genuine power ? I had no
s}iiipathy with their appearance, their expression; yet I
could imagine that most observers would call them attractive,
handsome, imposing; while they would pronounce Mr.
Bochester at once harsh-featured and melancholy-lookiDg.
I saw them smile, laugh — it was nothing ; the Ught of the
candles had as much soul in it as their smile ; the tinkle of
the bell as much significance as their laugh. I saw Mr,
Bochester smile — ^his stern features softened ; his eye grew
both brilliant and gentle, its ray both searching and eweei.
Ho was talking, at the moment, to Louisa and Amy Eshton.
I wondered to see them receive with calm that look which
seemed to me so penetrating ; I expected their eyes to falL

mean only that I have < & ■□ tastes and feelings in common
with him. I must thi iX continually that we are for
aver sundered ; — and .e I breathe and think I must
love him.'
Coffee is hande The ladles, since the gentlemen
entered, have becouid lively as larks ; conversation waxes
Wisk and merry. Colonel Dent and Mr. Esbton argue on
pobtics : their wives listen. The two proud dowagers, Lady
Lynn and Lady Ingram, confabulate together. Sir Qeorge —
wfaom, by-the-by, I have forgotten to describe — a very hig
and very fresh-looking country gentleman, stands before
their sofa, coffee-cup in hand, and occasionally puts in a
word. Mr. Frederick Lynn has taken a seat beside Mary
Ingram, and is sbowing her the engrayings of a splendid
volume ; she looks, smiles now and then, but apparently
says little. The tall and phlegmatic Lord Ingram leans
with folded arms on the chair-back of the little and lively
Amy Eshton; she glances up at him, and ohattert like a
wren : she likes htm better than she does Mr. Bochester.
Henry Lynn has taken possession of an ottoman at the feet
of Lintisa ; Adile shares it with him : he is trying to talk

whom win Bhu:iche Ingram pair? She is standing alooa at
the table, bending gracefoUy oyer an aUmm. She seems
waiting to be sought; but she will not wait too long : ihe
herself seleets a mate.
Mr. Boehester, having quitted the Eshtons, stands on
the hearth as solitary as she stands by the table ; she con-
fronts him, taking her station on the opposite side of the
mantel^ece.
'Mr. Bochester, I thonj^t yon were not fond of

'Then, what induced yon to take charge of such a little

'I could not afford it; schools sre so dear.*
'Why, I suppose you have a governess for her; I saw a
person with her just now — ^is she gone ? Oh, no, there she

I should think it quite as expensive — more so, for yon have
them both to keep in addition.'
I feared — or should I say, hoped — ^the allusion to ma
would make Mr. Bochester glance my way ; and I involun-
tsrily shrank further into the shade ; but he never turned
his eyes.
'I have not considered the subject^'said he indifEorently^
looking straight before him.
'No — you men never do consider economy and conmnm

'What are they, madam 7'inquired Mr. Bochester
aloud.
'I will tell you in your private ear,'replied she, wagging
her turban three times with portentous significanoy.
'But my curiosity will be past its appetite ; it craves food
now.'
'Ask Blanche ; she ia nearer you than I.'

Mary was always too sleepy to join in a plot with spirit. The

waking sensation strangely. I waited till the last deep and
full vibration had expired— till the tide of talk, checked an
instant, had resumed its Sow ; I then quitted iny sheltered
comer and made my exit by the side-door, which was
fortunately near. Thence a narrow passage led into the
ball ; in crossing it, I perceived my sandal was loose ; I
stopped to tie it, kneeling down for that purpose on the mat

unclose ; a gentleman came out ; rising hastily, I stood face
to face with him : it was Mr. Bochestar.

'I am very well, tar.'

Ubbir days were these B.t Thomfield Hall ; and busy dayg
too: how difToreot from the first three mooths of gtiUncss,
monotony, and solitude I had paeaed beneath its roof I All
Bad feelings seemed now drives from the house, all gloomy
nesOGtationB forgotten : there was life everywhere, movement
all day long. Yoa could not now traverse the gallery, once
so hashed, nor enter the front chambers, once so tenantless,
without encountering a smart lady's maid, or a dandy
valet.
The kitchen, the butler's pantiy, the servants'hall, the
entrance hall, were equally alive ; and the saloons were only
left void and still when the blue eVy and halcyon sunshine of
the genial spring weather called their ocenpanta out into the
gioondB. Even when that weather was broken, and oon-
tinnons rain set in tor some days, no damp Beemed cast over
enjoyment; indoor amusements only became more lively
and varied, in oonseqoenoe of the stop put to outdoor
gaiety.
I wondered what they were going to do the first evening
a change of entertainment was proposed; they spoke of
'playing oharadea,'but in my ignorance I did not understand
the term. The servants were called in, the dining-room
tables wheeled away, the lights otherwise disposed, the ohaiit
placed in a semidrcle opposite the arch. While Mr. Boobester
and the other gentlemen directed these alterations, the ladies
were running up and down stairs ringing tor their maids.
Mrs. Fairfax was summoned to give information respecting
the resources of the boose in shawls, dresses, draperies at
any kind; and certain wardrobes of the third story were

ransacked, and flidr eontenta, in the shape of biooaded and
hooped petticoalB, saliii saeqnes, Uack modes, laoe lappeti»
& c., were brought down in armfuls by the Abigails; then a
selection was made, and sneh things as were chosen were
carried to the boudoir within the drawing-room.
Meantime, Mr. Bocbester had again summoned the ladies
round him, and was selecting certain oC their number to be ol
his party.'ICss Ingram is mine, oC eourse,* said be; after-
wards he named the two IGssesEshton, and Mrs. Deni. He
looked at me ; I happened to be near him, as I had been
fastening the dasp of Mrs. Dent's bracelet^ which had got
loose.
'Will you play 7* he asked. I shook my head. He did
not insist, which I rather feared he would have done ; he'
allowed me to return quZ^y to my usual seal
He and his aids now withdrew behind the curtain ; the
other party, which was headed by CSdonei Dent^ sat down on
the crescent of chairs. One of Uie gentlemen, Mr. Eshton,
observing me, seemed to propose that I should be asked to
join them; but Lady Ingram instantly negatiyed the
notion. .
'No,'I heard her say : * she looks too stupid for any
game of the sort.'
Ere long, a bell tinkled, and the curtain drew up.
Within the arch the bulky figure of Sir George Lynn, whom
Mr. Rochester had likewise chosen, was seen enveloped in a
white sheet ; before him, on a table, lay open a large book ;
and at his side stood Amy Eshton, draped in Mr. Bochester^s
cloak, and holding a book in her hand. Somebody, unseen,
rang the bell merrily ; then Ad^le (who had insisted on being
one of her guardian's party), bounded forward, scattering
round her the contents of a huket of flowers she carried on
her arm. Then appeared the magnificent figure of Wm
Ingram, clad in white, a long veil on her head, and a wreath
of roses round her brow ; by her side walked Mr. Bochester,
and together they drew naar the table. They knelt^ while
Mrs. Dent and Louisa Eshfon, dressed also in white; took up

thoir stations behind tbein. A ceremony toUowed, in dumb
show, in which it wm easy to recognise the panlomime of a
tnarriage. At its termination Colonel Dent and hia party
consulted in whispers for two minutes, then the Colonel called
out, —'Bride 1'Mr, Bocbester hewed, and the curlua
feU.
A considerable interval elapsed before it again rose. Its
flecond rising displayed a moreetaborately prepared scene than
the last. The drawing-room, as I have before observed, was
raised two steps above the dining-room, and on the top of the
upper step, placed a yard or two back within the room,
appeared a large marble basin, wbioh I recognised as an
ornacsent of the conservatory — where it usually stood,
surrounded by exotics, and tenanted by gold fish — and
whence it must have been transported vritb some trouble, on
account of its taza and weight
Seated on the carpet, by the side of this basin, was seen
Sir. Bochester, costumed in shawls, with a turban on his
bead. His dark eyes and swarth skin and Paynim features
suited the costume exactly : he looked the very model of an
Eastern emir ; an agent or a victim of the bowstring.
Presently advanced into view Miss Ingram. She, too, was
attired in Oriental fashion : a crimson scarf tied sosh-like
round the waist ; an embroidered handkerchief knotted about
ber temples ; her beaulifully-monlded arms bare, one of them
Qp'raised in the act of supporting a pitcher, poised graoelully
OD her bead. Both her cast of form and feature, her
oomplesioD and her general ur, suggested the idea of some
Israelitish princess of the patriarchal days ; and such was
doubtless the character she intended to represent.
8he approached the basin, and bent over it aa if to fill her
pitcher; she again lifted it to her head. The personage on
the well-brink now seemed to accost her; to make some
request, —'She hasted, let down her pitcher on her hand and
gave him to drink.'From the bosom of his robe he then
produced a casket, opened it and showed magnifioent
bracelets and earrings ; she acted astonishment and admin*

'Well, whatever I am, remember you are my wife ; we
were married an hour since, in the presence ol all these
witneBseB.'She giggled, and her colour rose.
'Now, Dent,'oontinned Mr. Bochoster,'it ia your turn.'
And as the other parly withdrew, he and Ms band took the
vacated seats. Miss " Uned herself at her leader's
right hand ; the other d the chairs on each side
of him and her. I di ■ ..^Ich the actors; I no longer
waited with interest f lin to rise ; my attention was
absorbed by the spec'-^.y eyes, erewhile fixed on the
arch, were now irresi acted to the semicircle of chairs,
~ What charade Color ik and his party played, what word
they chose, how t'itcquitted themselves, I no longer
remember ; but I i vvt the consultation which followed
each scene : I see'heater turn to Miss Ingram, and

till the jetty curls almost touch his shoulder and wave against
his cheek; I hear theii mutual whisperings; I recall their
interchanged glances; and something even of the feeling
roused by the speotacla returns in memory at this moment.
I have told you, reader, that I had learnt to love Mr,
Rochester ; I could not unlove him now, merely because I
found that he had ceased to notice me — because I might paa
hours in his presence and he would never once turn his eye
in my direction — because I saw all his attentions appropriate
by ft great lady, who scorned to toacb me vritb the hem
her robes as she passed ; who, if ever her dark knd imperio

This was the point — this was wbere the nerve was touched
and teased — this waa where the fever was sustained and fed :
she could no{ chann kirn, ■
If she had managed the victory at once, and ha had
yielded and sincerely laid bis heart at her feet, I should have
covered my face, turned to the wall, and (figuratively) have
died to them. If Miss Ingram had been a good and noble
woman, endowed with force, fervour, kindoeBa, sense, I
should have hod one vital struggle with two tigers — jealouBy
and despair : then, my heart torn out and devoured, I should
have admired her — acknowledged her excellence, and been
quiet for the rest of my days : and the more absolute her
superiority, the deeper would have been my admiration —
the more truly tranquil my quiescence. But as matters
really stood, to watch Miss Ingram's efforts at fascinating
Mr. Rochester; to witness their repeated failure — herGelf
unconscious that they did fail; vainly fancying that each
shaft launched hit the mark, and infatuatedly pluming her-
self on success, when her pride and self-complacency repelled
further and further what she wished to allure— to witness
thtM, was to be at once under ceaseless excitation and mth-
lesB reetrunt.
Because, when she failed, I saw how she might have
succeeded. Arrows that continually glanced off from Mr.
Rochester's breast and fell harmless at his feet, might, I
knew, if shot by a surer band, have quivered keen in his
prond heart — have called love into his stem eye and softness
into his sardonic face; or, better still, withont weapons a
silent conquest might have been won.
'Why can she not influence him more, when she ii
privileged to draw so near to him ?'I asked myself.'Sorely
she cannot truly like him, or not like him with true affection.
If she did, she need not coin her smiles so lavishly, flash ber
glances so unremittingly, manufacture airs so elaborate,
graces so multitudinous. It seems to me that she ought, by
merely sitting quietly at bia side, saying little and looking

lifferent expression from that which hardens it now while

tself* it was not elicited by meretricions arts and ealcnlatefll

without grimace — and it increased and grew kinder and
Luore genial, and warmed one like a fostering sunbeam.
tlow will she manage to please him when they are married?
[ do not think she will manage it ; and yet it might be
managed and his wife might, I verily believei be the very
happiest woman the sun shines on.*
I have not yet said auything condemnatory of Mr
Rochester's project of marrying for interest and connexions
It surprised me when I first discovered that such was his
intention ; I had thought him a man unlikely to be influenced
by motives so conmiODplace in his choice of a wife ; but the
longer I considered the position, education, Ac., of the parties^
the less I felt justified in judging and blaming either him or
Miss Ingram, for acting in conformity to ideas and principles
instilled into them, doubtless, from their childhood. All
their class held these principles ; I supposed, then, they had
reasons for holding them such as I could not fathom. It
seemed to me that, were I a gentleman like him, I wotdd
take to my bosom only such a wife as I could love ; but the
very obviousness of Uie advantages to the husband's own
happiness, offered by this plan, convinced me that there
must be arguments against its general adoption of which I
was quite ignorant; otherwise I felt sure all the world
would act as I wished to act.
But in other points, as well as this, I was growing very
lenient to my master : I was forgetting all his faults, for
which I had once kept a sharp look-out. It had formerly
been my endeavour to study all sides of his character ; to
take the bad with the good ; and from the just weighing of
both to form an equitable judgment. Now I saw no bad.

staftle < 3 me once, were only like keen condiments in a choice
iish : their presence was pungent, but their absence would
bo felt as comparatively insipid. And as for the vague
Bomething— was it a sinister or a sorrowful, a designing or a
desponding expression ? — that opened upon a careful observer,
now and then, in his eye and closed again before one could
fathom the strange depth partially disclosed ; that something
which used to make me fear and shrink, as if I bad been
wandering amongst volcanic-looking hills, and had suddenly
felt the ground quiver, and seen it gape ; that something I
at intervals beheld still, and with throbbing heart, but not
with palsied nerves. Instead of wishing to shun, I longed
only to dare — to divine it; and I thought Miss Ingram
happy, because one day she might look into the abyss at ber
leisure, explore its secrets, and aualyse their nature.
Meantime, while I thought only ot my master and his
future bride— saw only them, heard only their discourse,
and considered only their movements of importance— the
rest ot the party were occupied with their own separate
interests and pleasures. The ladies Lynn and Ingram
eontinned to consort in solemn ooi.ferences, when they
nodded their two turbans at each other, and held up their
four bands in confronting gestures of surprise, or mystery,
at borroi, according to the theme on which their gossip ran,
like a pair of magnified puppets. Mild Mrs, Dent talked
with good-natured Mrs. Esbton; and the two sometimes
bestowed a courteous word or smile on me. Sir George
Lynn, Colonel Dent, and Mr. Eshton discussed politics, or
ooimty affairs, or justice business. Lord Ingram flirted
with Amy Eshton ; Louisa played and sang to and with one
of the Messrs. Lynn ; and Mary Ingram listened languidly
to the gallant speeches of the otlier. Sometimes all, as with
one consent, suspended their by-play to observe and listen
to the principal actors ; for, after all, Mr. Boohester, and —
becanse closely connected with lum — Miss Ingram, were tba
life and soul ot the party. If he was absent from the room
an hour, a perceptible dolness seemed to steal over the

spirits of Us guests, and his xe-eniruiee was anre to giTe a
fresh impulse to the vivacity of conversatioiL
The want of his animating influence appeared to be
peculiarly felt one day that he had been summoned to
Millcote on business, and was not likely to return till late.
The afternoon was wet : a walk the party had propooed to
take to see a gipsy camp, lately pitched on a common beyond
Hay, was consequently deferred. Some of the gentlraoen
were gone to the staUes; the younger ones, together with
the younger ladies, were plaj^ng billiards in the billiard-
room. The dowagers Ingram and Lynn sought solace in a
quiet game at cards. Blanche Ingram, after having repelled,
by supercilious taciturnity, some efiforts of Mrs. Dent and
Mrs. Eshton to draw her into conversation, had first
murmured over some sentimental tunes and airs on the
piano, and then, having fetched a novel from the library,
had flung herself in haughty listlessness on a sofa, aiMl
prepared to beguile, by the spell of flction, the tedious houre
of absence. The room and the house were silent ; only now
and then the merriment of the billiard players was heard
from above.
It was verging on dusk, and the dock had already j^ven
warning of the hour to dress for dinner, when little Adile,
who knelt by me in the drawing-room window-seat^ ex-
claimed, —'YoiU Monsieur Bochester, qui revient I'
I turned, and Miss Ingram darted forwards from her
sofa ; the others, too, looked up from their several occupa-
tions; for at the same time a crunching of wheels, and a
splashing tramp of horse-hoofs became audible on the wel
gravel. A post-chaise was approaching.
'What can possess him to come home in that style?'
said Miss Ingram.'He rode Mesrour (the black horse), did
he not, when he went out? and Pilot was with him, — ^whal
has he done with the animals ?'
As she said this, she approached her tall person and

eftgemess she dicl not observe me at first, but when she clicl,
Bhe curled her lip aad moved to another casement. The
post-chaise stopped, the driver rang the door bell, and a,
genllem & n alighted, attired in travelling garb; bat it was
not Mr. Bochcster ; it was a tall, lasbionnble- looking man, a,
stranger.
• Provoking I'exclaimed Misa Ingram :'you tiresome
monkey 1'(apostrophising Ad^le)'who perched you up in
the window to give false intelligence ?'and she cast on me
an angry glance, as if I were in fault.
Some parleying was audible in the halt, aad soon the
new-comer entered- He bowed to Lady Ingram, as deeming
her the eldest lady present.
'It appears I come at an inopportuue time, madam,'said
be :'when my friend, Mr. Bochester, is from home ; but I
arrive from a very long journey, and I think I may presume
60 f ar oo old and intimate acquaintance as to Inatal myself
here till be returoB.'
His manner was polite ; his acoent, in speaking, struck
me as being somewhat unusual, — not precisely foreign, hut
still not altogether English ; hig age might be about Mr.
Bochester's, — between thirty uid forty ; his complexion was
singularly sallow ; otherwise he waa a fine-looking man, at
first sight especially. Od closer examination you detected
something in his face that displeased ; or rather, that failed
to please. His features were regular, but too relaxed ; bis
eye was large and well cut, but the life looking out of it was
a tame, vacant Ule —at least so I thought.
The sound of the dressing-bell dispersed the party. It
was not till after diunet that I saw him again; he then
seemed quite at his ease. But I liked his physiognomy even
less than before ; it struck me as being, at the some time,
unsettled and inanimate. His eye wandered, and hod no
meaning in its wandering ; ttui gave him an odd look, such
ai I never remembered to have seen. For a handsome and
not an unamiable-looking man, he repelled me exceedingly;
there was no power in that smooth-skinned face of a taQ

oval shape ; no firmness in that aqniline noseb and small
cherry mouih ; there was no thought on the low, eiven foie-
head ; no command in that blank, brown eye.
As I sat in my usual nook, and looked at him with the
light of the girandoles on the mantelpiece beaming full over
him — (or he occupied an arm-chair, drawn close to the fire,
and kept shrinking still nearer, as if he were cold — ^I com-
pared him with Mr. Boches[ter. I think (with defsrenoe be
it spoken) the contrast could not be much greater between a
sleek gander and a fierce falcon : between a meek sheep and
the rough-coated keen-eyed dog, its guardian.
He had spoken of Mr. Bochester as an old Mend. A
curious fnendship theirs must have been : a pointed illus-
tration, indeed, of the old adage that'extremes meet.'
Two or three of the gentlemen sat near him, and I
caught at times scraps of their conversation across the room.
At first I could not make much sense of what I heard; for
the discourse of Louisa Eshton and Mary Ingram, who aal
nearer to me, confused the fragmentary sentences that
reached me at intervals. These last were discussing the
stranger : they both called him a'beautiful man.* Louisa
said he was'a love of a creature,* and she'adored him':
and Mary instanced his'pretty Utile mouth, and nice nose,'
as her ideal of the charming.
'And what a sweet-tempered forehead he has I* cried
Louisa, —'so smooth — none of those frowning irregularities
I dislike so much : and such a placid eye and smile I *
And then, to my great relief, Mr. Henry Lynn summoned
them to the other side of the room, to settle some point
about the deferred excursion to Hay Common.
I was now able to concentrate my attention on the groop
by the fire, and I presently gathered that the new-comer t^'^
was called Mr. Mason : then I learnt that he was but just
arrived in England, and that he came from some hot
country : which was the reason, doubtless, his face was so
sallow, and that he sat so near the hearth, and wore a surtoni
in the house. Presently the words, Jamaica, Kingston,

Spaoisb Town, indicated the West Indies as his residence;
and it w & s with do little Burprisa I g;xthered, ere long, that
he had there first seen and become acquainted with Mr.
Bochester. He spoke of his friend's dislike of the burning
heats, the hurricanes, and rtuny seasons of that region. I
knew Mr. Bochester had been a traveller : Mrs. Fairfax had
said so ; but I thought the continent of Europe had bounded
his wanderings : till now I had never heard a hint given of
visits to more distant shores.
I was pondering these things, when an incident, and
& somewhat unexpected one, broke the thread of my
musings. Mr. M^ason, shivering as some one chanced to
open the door, asked for more coal to he put on the fire,
which had burnt out its flame, though its mass of cinder sUll
shone hot and red. The footman who brought ihe coal, in
going out, stopped near Mr. Eshton's chair, and said some-
thing to him in a low voice, of which I heard only the words,
y~-'old woman,'—'quite troublesome.'
'Tell her she shall be put in the stocks if she docs not
take herself off,'replied the magiBtrate.
- - -'No — stop I'interrupted Colonel Dent.'Don't send
her away, Esbloa; we might turn the thing to account;
better oonsnit the ladies.'And speaking aloud, he continued,
'Ladies, yon talked of going to Hay Common to visit the
gipsy camp ; Sam, here, says that one of the old Mother
Bnnches is in the servants'hall at this moment, and insists
upon being brought in before " the quality, " to tell them
their fortunes. Would you like to see her 7'
'Sorely, colonel,'cried Lady Ingram,'yoQ would not
encourage such a low impostor. Dismiss her, by all means,
atonoal'
■ But I cannot persuade her to go away, my lady,'sud the
footman ;'not can any of the servants : Mrs. Fairfax is with
her just now, entreating her to be gone ; but she has taken
a chair in the chimney-corner, and says nothing shall stir
her from it till she gets leave to come in here.'
'What does she want ?'asked Mrs. Eshton.

The footman still lingered.'She looks sueh a rou^

'Go !'ejaculated Miss Ingram, and the man went.
Excitement instantly seised the whole party : a ruiming
fire of raillery and jests was proceeding when Sam re-
turned.
'She won't come now,'said he.'She says it's not her
mission to appear before the " vulgar herd'* (them's her
words). I must show her into a room by herself and
then those who wish to consult her must go to hear one
by one.*

'Tou see now, my queenly Blanche,'began Lady Ingram,
'she encroaches. Be advised, my angel girl — and'
'Show her into the library, of oourBe,'cut in the'angel
girL''It is not my mission to listen to her before the
vulgar herd either : I mean to have her all to myeeU. la

'Yes, ma'am — hut she looks such a tinkler.'
'Cease that chatter, blockhead t and do my bidding.'
Again Sam vanished ; and mystery, animation, ezpecta-
Uoa rose to full flov once more.
'She's ready now,'said the footman, as he reappeared.
'She wishes to know who will be her first visitor. "
'I think I bad better just look in upon her before any of
the ladies go,'said Colonel Dent.
'Tell her, Sam, a gentleman is coming.'
Sam went and returned.
'She says, sir, that she'll have no gentlemen ; they need
not trouble themselves to come near her : nor,'he added,
with difiGculty suppressing a titter,'any ladies either, except
the young and single.'
'By Jove, she has taste 1'e.Tclaimed Henry Lynn.
Miss Ingram rose solemnly :'I go first,'she said, in a
tone which might have befitted the leader of a forlorn hope,
moonting a breach in the van of his men.
'Oh, my best 1 oh, my deareat I pause — reflect 1'was
her mamma's cry ; but she swept past her in stately silence,
passed through the door which Colonel Dent held open, and
we heard her enter the library.
A comparaUve silence ensued. Lady Ingram thought it
'le cas'to wring her hands : which she did accordingly.
Miss Mary declared she felt, for her part, she never dw«d
venture. Amy and Louisa Eshton tittered under their
tereatb, and looked a little frightened.
The minutes passed very elowly : fifteen were ooimted
before the library-door again opened. Miss Ingram returned
to us throngh the arch.

eyes met her wiih a gUnoe of ouriodty, and ahe met all eyes
with one of rebuff and coldness : she looiked neither flurried
nor merry ; she walked stiffly to her seat^ and took it in
silence.
'Well, Blanche ?* said Ii(»rd Ingram.
* What did she say, sister 7 * asked Maiy.
* What did yon tldnk? How do yon feel t la she areal
foL'tune-teller ?'demanded the IGsses Bshton,
'Now, now, good people,* returned l£ss Ingram,'don*i
press upon me. Beally your organs of wonder and credulity
are easUy excited : you seem by the importance you all- > my
good mamma included— ascribe to this matter — absolately
to believe we have a genuine witch in the house, who is in
close alliance with the old gentleman, I have seen a gipsy-
vagabond; she has practised in hackneyed bahion the
science of palmistry, and told me what such people uaoally
telL My whim is gratified ; and now I think Mr. Eahton
will do well to put the hag in the stocks to-mcMrrow motmng,
as he threatened.'
Miss Ingram took a book, leant back in her chair, and.
80 declined further conversation. I watched her for nearly
half an hour : during all that time she never turned a page,
and her face grew momently darker, more dissatisfied, and
more sourly expressive of disappointment She had obviously
not heard anything to her advantage : and it seemed to me^
from her prolonged fit of gloom and taciturnity, that she
herself, notwithstanding her professed indifference, attached
undue importance to whatever revelations had been made her.
Meantime, Mary Ingram, Amy and Louisa Eshton^
declared they dared not go alone ; and yet they all vrished to
go. A negotiation was opened through the medium of the
ambassador, Sam; and after much pacing to and fro, tilL
I think, the said Sam's calves must have ached with the
exercise, permission was at last, with great difficulty
extorted from the rigorous Sibyl, for the three to wait upon
her in a body.
Their visit was not so still as Miss Ingram's had been :

they burst the door open, and came runniag across the hall,
as if they were half-scared out of their wits,
'I'm sure she is something not right I'they cried one and
ftIL'She told us such things I She knows all about us I'
and they sank breathless into the various seats the gentlemen
hastened to bring them.
Pressed for further explanation they declared she had
told them ot things they had said and done when they were
mere children ; described books and ornamenta tbey had in
their boudoirs at home; keepsakes thatdJETereot relations had
presented to them. They affirmed that she had even divined
their thoughts, and had whispered in the ear of each the
name of the person she liked best in the world, and informed
tbem of what they most wished for.
Here the gentlemen interposed with earnest petitions to
be further enlightened on these two last-n & med points ; but
they got only blushes, ejaculations, tremors, and titters, in
return for their importunity. The matrons, meantime, offered
vinaigrettes and wielded t & ns ; and again and agiun re-
iterated the expression of their ooncem that their warning
had not been taken in time ; and the elder gentlemen
laughed, and the younger urged their servioes on the agitated
bironee.
Id the midflt of the tomult, and while my eyes and ears
were folly engaged in the scene before me, I heard a hem
close at my elbow : I tamed and saw Sam.
'If you please, miss, the gipsy declares that there is
another young single lady in the room who has not been to
her yet, and c^e swears she will not go till she has seen all.

'Oh, I will go by all means,'I answered ; and I was glad
of the uaeipected opportunity to gratify my muob-ezoited

CHAPTEB XrX
Tbb library looked tranquil enough as I entered it, and the
Sibyl — it Sibji she were — was seated snugly enough in an
easy chair at the ohimney-comer. She had oa a red cloak
and a black bonnet: or rather, a broad-brimmed gipsy hat,
tied down with a striped handkerchief under her chin.
An extinguished candle stood on the table: she was
bending over the Sre, and seemed reading in a Uttia black
book, Uke a prayer-book, by the light of the blaze : she
muttered lbs words to herself, as most old women do, while
abe read ; she did not desist immediately on my entrance : it
appeared she wished to finish a paragraph.
I stood on the rug and warmed my hands, which
were rather cold with sitting at a distance from thedrawing-
room fire. I felt now as composed as ever I did in my life :
there was nothing indeed in the gipsy's appearance to trouble
one's calm. She shot her book and slowly looked op ; her
hat-brim partially shaded her face, yet I could see as she
raised it, that it was a strange one. It looked all brown
and black : elf-locks bristled oat from beneath » white band
which passed nnder her chin, and came half over her cheeks
or rather jaws ; her eye confronted me at once, with a bold
and direct gasa.
'Well, and you want your fortune told 7'she said in a
voice as decided as her glance, as harsh as her featmvs.
'I don't care about it, mother ; you may please yourself ;
bnt I ought to warn you, I have no faith.'
'It's like your impudence to say so : I expected it of yoQ ;
I beard it in your step as you crossed the threshold.'
* IMd you 7 You've a quick ear.'

• Why don't you turn pale?'
'I am not sick.
'Why don't you consult my art'
• I'm not siUy/
The old crone * nichered'a laugh under her bonnet and
bandage : she then drew out a short, black pipe, and lighting
it began to smoke. Having indulged a while in this seda-
tive, she raised her bent body, took the pipe from her lips,
and while gazing steadily at the fire, said very deliberately :
—'You are cold ; you are sick ; and you are silly/
'Prove it,'I rejoined:
'I will ; in few words. You are cold, because yoa are
alone : no contact strikes the fire from you that is in you.
You are sick : because the best of feelings, the highest and
the sweetest given to man, keeps far away from you. Yoa
are silly, because, suflter as you may, you will not beckon it
to approach ; nor will you stir one step to meet it where it
waits you,'
She again put her short, Uack pipe to her lips, and re-
newed her smoking with vigour.
'You might say all that to almost any one who, yoa
knew, lived as a solitary dependant in a great house.*
'I might say it to almost any one ; but would it be true
of almost any one 7'
'In my circumstances.*
'Yes ; just so, in your circumstances : but find me
another precisely placed as you are.*
'It would be easy to find you thousands,*
'You could scarcely find me one. If you knew
it, you are peculiarly situated : very near hapfuneas ;
yes ; within reach of it. The materials are all prepared ;
there only wants a movement to combine them. Chanoe

'I don't understand enigmas. I never ooold gness a
liddle in my life.'
'If you wish me to Bpeak more plainly, show me your
palm.'
'And I must cross it with silver, I Bnppose ?'
• To be sure.'
I gave her a shilling: she put it into an old stocking-foot
which she look out of her pocket, and having tied it round
and returned it, she told me to hold out my hand. I did.
Bbe approatihed her face to the palm, and pored over it with-
out tonohing it.
'It is too fine,'said she.'I can make nothing of snob a
band & B that; almost withont lines: besides, what is in a
palm 7 Destiny is not written there.'
'I believe yon,* said I,
'No,'she continued,'it is in the face : on the forehead,
kbout the eyes, in the eyes themselves, in the lines of the
month. Kneel, and hft up your bead.'
'Ah I now you are coming to reality,'I said as I obeyed
her.'I shall begin to put some faith in you presently.'
I knelt within half a yard of her. She stirred the fire, so
that a ripple of light broke from the disturbed coal : the glare,
however, as she sat, only threw her face into deeper shadow :
mine, it illumined.
'I wonder with what feelings you came to me to-night,'
she sud, when she had examined me a while.'I wonder
what thought* are busy in your heart during all the hours
yon at in yonder room with the fine people flitting before yoa
like shapes in a magic lantern : just as little sympatbelio
communion pasdng between you and them, as if they were
really mere shadows of human forms and not the aotoal
Bobstanoe.'
'I feel Ured often, sleepy sometimes ; but seldom a*d.'
'Then yon have some secret hope to ba < ^ yoa op and

out your hand, and take it up ; but whether you will do so,
is the problem I study. Kneel again on the rag.'
'Don't keep me long ; the fire scorches me.'
I knelt She did not etoop towards me, but only gazed
leaning back in her chair. She began muttering, — " The
flame flickers in the eye, the eye shines like dew : it looks
Boft and full of feeh'ng ; it smiles at my jargon : it is
B & Bceptible; impression follows impression through its
clear sphere ; where it ceases to smile, it is sad ; an
unconscious lassitude weighs on the bd: that signifies
melancholy resulting from loneliness. It turns from me ; it
will not suffer farther scrutiny ; it seems to deny, by a mock-
ing glance, the truth of the disooveries I have already made,
— to disown the charge both of sensibihty and chagrin : its
pride and reserra only confirm me in my opinion. The eye
is favonraUe.
'As to the mouth, it deli ghts at times in laughter ; it is
disposed to impart all that the brain oonceives; though I
daresay it would be silent on much the heart experiences.
Mobile and flexible, it was never intended to becompressed in
the eternal ulence of soUtude : it is a mouth which should
^ > eak much and smile often and have human affection for
its interlocutor. That feature too is propitioos.
'I see no enemy to a fortunate issue Imt in the brow ; and

to buy bliss. I have an inward treasure, bora with me,
which can keep me alive if all extraueoas delight* should be
withheld ; or offered only at a price I cannot aSbrd to pve. "

them I have attended to the claims of conscience, the
counsels of reason. I know how soon youth would & de
and bloom perish, if, in the cup of bliss offered, but one dreg
of shame, or one flavour of remorse were detected; and I
do not want sacrifice, sorrow, dissolution — such is not my
taste. I wish to foster, not to blight — ^to earn gratitude, m^
to wring tears of blood—no, nor of brine : my harvest must be
in smiles, in endearments, in sweet — ^That will do. I think
I rave in a kind of exquisite delirium. I should wish now
to protract this moment ad infiniHim ; but I dare not. So
far I have governed myself thoroughly. I have acted as
I inwardly swore I would act; but farther might try me
beyond my strength. Bise, Miss Byre : leave me ; ** the play
is played out " *
Where was I? Did I wake or sleep? Had I been
dreaming? Did I dream still? The old woman's voioe
had changed : her accent, her gesture, and aU were familiar
to me as my own face in a glass — as the speech of my own
tongue. I got up, but did not go. I looked; I stirred the
fire, and I looked again : but she drew her bonnet and her
bandage closer about her face, and again beckoned me to
depart. The flame illuminated her hand stretched out:
roused now, and on the alert for discoveries, I at onoe
noticed that hand. It was no more the withered limb of eld
than my own; it was a rounded supple member, with
smooth fingers, symmetrically turned ; a broad ring flashed
on the little finger, and stooping forward, I looked at it, and
saw a gem I had seen a hundred times before. Again I
looked at the face ; which was no longer turned from me—
on the contrary, the bonnet was doffed, the bandage displaced,
the head advanced.

''Well, Jane, do you know me ? " a3lted the familiar voloe.
'Only take off the red cloak, sir, and then'
'But the string is in a knot— help me.'
• Break it, sir. "
'There, then— " Off, ye lendings 1 "'
t And Mr. Rochester stepped out of hia disguise.
'Now, sir, what a strange idea I'
'But well carried oat, eh ? Don't you think so ?
'With the ladies you must have managed welL*
'But not with yon ?'
'YoQ did not act the character of a gipsy with me.'
'What character did I act ? My own 7'
''No ; some unaccountable one. In ebort, I believe yon
bave been trying to draw me out — or in ; yon have been
talking nonsense to make me talk nonsense. It is scarcely
bur, sir.'
'Do you forgive me, Jane 7'
'I cannot tell till I have thought it all over. If, on ra-
flecUon, I find I have fallen into no great absurdity, I
shall try to forgive you ; but it was not right. "
'Oh I you have been very correct— very careful, very
Bennble.'
I reflected, and thought, on the whole, I had. It was a
comfort ; bat, indeed, I had been on my guard almost from
the beginning of the interview. Something of masquerade I
sospected. I knew gipsies and fortune- tellers did not express
themselves as this seeming old woman had expressed ber-
self ; beudes, I had noted her feigned voice, her anxiety to
ooDceal her features. But my mind had been ronning on
Grace Poole— that living enigma, that mystery of mysteriet,
u I considered her. I bad never thought of Mr. Boohester.
'Well,'said be,'what are you musing about? What
does that grave smile signify 7'
'Wonder and self-congratulaUon, ur. I have your per-
mission to retire now, I suppose 7'
*No; stay a moment; and tell me what the pet^ io

'Discussing ttie gipsy, I daresay.
< Sit down 1 — Let me hear what they said about me.'
* I had better not stay long, sir ; it most be near eleven
o'clock. Oh 1 are you aware, Mr. Bochester, that a stranger
has arrived here since you kit this morning?'
'A stranger I — no; who can it bef I expected no one;
is he gone?'
'No ; he said he had known yon long, . and that be
could take the liberty of installing himself here till yoa
returned.'
.'The devil he did I Did he give his name ? *
'His name is Mason, sir ; and he comes from the West
Indies ; from Spanish Town, in Jamaica, I think.'
Mr. Bochester was standing near me ; he had taken my
hand, as if to lead me to a chair. As I spoke, he gave my
wrist a convulsive grip ; the smile on his lips froze : appa >
rently a spasm caught his breath.
'Mason I —the West Indies I'he said, in the tone one
might fancy a speaking automaton to enounce its dn^
^ words ;'Mason 1 — the West Indies 1'he reiterated ; and he
j went over the syllables three times, growing, in the intervals
j of speaking, whiter than ashes : he hardly seemed to know
what he was doing.

staggered.
'Oh 1— lean on me, or.'
'Jane, you offered me your shoulder once before ;'let me
have it now.*
'Yes, sir, yes ; and my arm.'
He sat down, and made me sit beside him. Holding my
hand in both his own, he chafed it ; gazing on me, at the
same time, with the most troubled and dreary look.
'My httle friend I'said he,'I wish I were in a quiet
island with only you ; and trouble, and danger, and bideoos
recollections removed from me.'
'Can I help you, sir ? — I'd give my Ufe to serve yoo.*

'Jane, if aid la wanted, I'll seek it at youi hands; I
promise yon UiaL'
'Thank you, sir ; tell me what to do, — I'll try, at least,
to do it.'
'Fetch ma now, Jane, a glass of wine from the dining-
room ; they will be at supper there ; and tell me if Mason is
with them, and what he is doing.'
I went. I found all the party in the dining-room at
supper, as Mr. Rochester had said ; they were not seated at
table, — the supper was arranged on the side-board ; each
hod taken what he chose, and they stood about here and
there in groups, their plates and glasses in their hands.
Every one seemed in high glee ; laughter and cor & ersation
were general and animated. Mr. Mason stood near the fire,
talking to Colonel and Mrs. Dent, and app(?ared as merry as
any of them. I filled a wine-glass (I saw Miss Ingram watch
me frowningly as I did so : she thought I was taking a liberty,
I daresay), and I returned to the library.
Mr. Rochester's extreme pallor had disappeared, and he
looked once more firm and stem. He took the glass from
my hand.
'Here is to yonr health, ministrant spirit I'ha said : he
swallowed the contents and retnmed it to me.'What are
they doing, Jajie ?'
< laughing and taUdng, nr.'
'Thay don't look grave and mysterious, as if they had
heard something strange 7'
'Not at all — they are full of jests and giUety.*
'And Mason 7'
'He was laughing too.*
'If all these people came in a body and spat at me, what
woold yon do, Jane 7'
* Tom them out of the room, ^, if I oould.'
He half smiled.'Bnt if I were to go to them, and they
only looked at me coldly, and whispered sneeringly amongst
each other, and then dropt off and left me one by one, what
then? Would yon go with them?'

'Go back now into the room ; step quietly up to Maoon,
and whisper in his ear that Mr. Bochester is come and

• Yes,'8ir/
I did his behest. The company all stared at me as I
passed straight among them. I sought Mr. Mason, delivered
the message, and preceded him from the room : I ushered
him into the library, and then I went upstairs.
At a late hour, after I had been in bed some time, I
heard the visitors repair to their chambers : I distinguished
Mr. Bochester's voice, and heard him say,'This way.
Mason ; this is your room.'
He spoke cheerfully : the gay tones set my heart at
I was soon asleep.

I HAD forgotten to w my cm which I usually did ;
and also to let do\ my window-Dund. The consequence
was, that when the moon, which was full and biight (for the
night van fine], came in her course to that space in the sky
opposite my casement, and looked in at tna through the
unveiled panes, her glorious gaze roused me. Awaking in
the dead of night, I opened my eyes on her disk — eilver-
white and crystaJ- clear. It was beautiful, but too solemn : I
half rose, and stretched my arm to draw the curtain.
Good God I What a cry I
The night — its sUence — its rest, was rent in twain, by a
savage, a sharp, a shrilly sound that ran torn end to end of
Thomfield HolL
My pulse stopped : my heart stood still ; my stretched
arm vaa paralysed. The cry died, and was not renewed.
Indeed, whatever being nttered that fearful shriek could not
aoon repeat it : not the widest- winged condor on the Andes
could, twice in succession, send out such a yell from the
cloud shrouding his ejTie. The thing delivering such utter-
ance must rest ere it could repeat the effort.
It came out of the third story ; for it passed overhead.
And overhead — yes, in the room just above my chamber
ceiling — I now heard a struggle : a deadly one it seemed
from the noise; and a half -smothered voice shouted —'Help I
help t help f'three times rapidly.
'Will no one come 7'it cried ; and then, while the stag'
gering and stamping went on wildly, I distinguished through
plank and plaster : —'Boohesler I Rochester 1 for God's sake,

Kot, however, to go to bed : on the contrary, I began and

room above mine : but they asaurod me that it was not &
eervant'e dream wluch had thus struck horror through the
house ; and that the explanation " Mi. Bochester had ^ven
was merely an invention framed to pacify his guests. I
dressed, then, to be ready for emergencies. When dressed,
I sat a long time by the vrindow, looking out over the silent
grounds and silvered fields, and waiting for I knew not what.
It seemed to me that some event must follow the strange cry,

No : stilluess returned : each mormur and movement
oeased gradually, and in about an hour Thomfield Hall was

had resumed their empire. Meantime the moon declined:
she was about to set. Not liking to sit in the cold and
darkness, I thought I would lie down on my bed, dressed as
I was. I left the nindow, and moved with little noise aoross
the carpet ; as I stooped to take off my shoes, a eautious
hand tapped low at the door.
'Am I wanted ?'I asked.
'Are you up?'asked the vdoe I expected to hear, vis.

almost like a dog quarrelling. Mr. Rochester, putting down
his candle, saJd to me,'Wait a minute, " and he went forward
to the inner apartment. A shout of laughter greeted his
i entrance; noisy at first, and terminating in Grace Poole's
^'own goblin ha 1 ha 1 SA« then was there. He made some
sort of arrangement, without speaking: though I heard a
tow voice addiesB him : he came out and closed the door
behind him.
'Here, Jane I'he said ; and I walked round to the other
nde of a large bed, which with its drawn curtains concealed
a considerable portion of the chamber. An easy-chair was
near the bed-head : a man sat in it, dressed Viith the
exception of his coat ; he was still ; his head leant back ;
his eyes were closed. Mr. Rochester held the candle over
him ; I recognised in his pale and seemingly lifeless face — the
stranger, Mason : I saw too that his linen on one side, and
one arm, was almost soaked in bloon).
'Hold the candle,'said Mr. Rochester, and I took it ; he
fetched a basin of water from the wash-stand :'Hold that,'
said he. I obeyed. He took the sponge, dipped it in and
moistened the corpse-like face : he asked for my smelling-
bottle, and applied it to the nostrils. Mr. Mason shortly
unclosed hia eyes ; be groaned. Mr. Rochester opened the
shirt of the wounded man, whose arm and shoulder were
bandaged : he sponged away blood, trickling fast down.
'Is there immediate danger,'mormured Mr. Mason.
'Foohl No — a mere scratch. Don't be bo overcome,
man : bear up 1 I'll fetch a surgeon for you now, myaeU:
you'll be able to be removed by morning, I hope. Jane,'be
oonUnned.
'Sir?'
'I shall have to leave you in this room with this gentle*
man, for an hour, or porbapa two hours ; yon \ri\l apcmge
the blood as I do when it returns : if he feels faint, yon will
pat the glass of water on that stand to his lips, and your
salts to his nose. You will not speak to him on any pretext
— and— Kchard — it will be at the peril of your life If yon
JANE EYHB S5S
speak to her : qpen joar lips— agltete yourself— ftiid IH nol
answer for Iha oonseqaenoes.'
Again the poor man groaned : he looked as if he dared
not moTs: lear, eiihor of death or of something else,
appeared ahnost to paralyse him. Mr. Rochester put the
now bloody sponge into my hand, and I proceeded to use it
as be bad done. He watched me a second, then saying
'Remember 1— No oonyersation.'he left the room. I
experienced a strange feeling as the key grated in the
lock, and the soond of his retreating step ceased to be
heard.
Here then I was in the third story, fastened into one of
its mystic cells; nigjht aromid me; a pale and bloody
spectacle mider my eyes and hands; a murderess hardly
separated from me by a single door : yes — ^that was ajqial-
ling— the rest I could bear ; but I shuddered at the thought
of Grace Poole bursting out upon me.
I must keep to my post» howeyer. I must wateh this
ghastly countenance — ^these blue» still iips ftNrbiddeii to
unclose — these eyes now shut, now opening, now wandering
through the room, now fixing on me, and ever glazed with
the dulness of horror. I must dip my hand again and agun
in the basin of Uood and water, and wipe avray the trickling
gore. I must see the light of the unsnuflEed candle wane on
my employment; the shadows darken on the wrought-antique
tapestry round me, and grow Uack under the hangings of
the vast old bed« and qxiiver strangely over the doors of a
great calunet opposite — whose front, divided into twelve
panels, bora in grim design the heads of the twelve apostles*
each inclosed in its separate panel as in a frame; while
above them at the top rose an ebon crucifix and a dying
Christ.
.According as the shifting obscurity and flickering (^eam
bovered here or glanced there, it was now the bearded
physician, Luke, that bent his brow ; now 8t John's long
hair that waved; and anon the devilish face of Judas,
that grew out of the panely and seemed gathering life and
^PWV^V^I^B
JANE EYRE
threatening a rerelatioQ of the arch-traitor — of Satan biinseU
— in hia Bubordinate's form.
Amidst all this, I had to listen as well as watch : to listen
for the movements of the wild beaat or the fiend in yonder
side den. But unce Mr. Rochester's visit it seemed spcU-
bouod : all the night I heard but three sounds at three
long intervals, — a step creak, a momentary renewal of the
snarling, canine noise, and a deep human groan.
Then my own thoughts worried me. What crime was
tins, that lived inoamate in this sequestered mansion, and
ooold neither be expelled nor subdued by the owner ?— What
mystery, that broke ont, now in fire and now in blood, at the
deadest hom^ of night ? What creature was it, that, masked
in an ordinary woman's face and shape, uttered the voice, now
of a mocking demon, and anon of a carrion-seeking bird
of prey ?
And this man I bent over— this commonplace, qniet
etranger— how had he become involved in the web of honor?
and why had the Fury flown at him ? What made him seek
this qnarter of the bouse at an untimely season, when he
should have been asleep in bed ? I had heard Mr. Rochester
assign him an apartment below — what brought him here?
And why, DOW, was he so tame under the violence or'
treachery done him? Why did he bo quietly submit to the
concealment Mr. Rochester enforced 7 Why did Mr. Roches-
ter enforce this concealment 7 His guest had been outraged,
his own life on a former occacdon had been hideously plotted
against; and both attempts he smothered in secrecy and
sank in oblivion t lAstly, I saw Mr. Mason was submissive
to Mr. Rochester ; that tiie impetuous will of the latter held
complete sway over the inerbiess of the former : the few
words which had passed between them assured me of this.
It was evident that in their former intercourse, the passive
dispoatim of the one had been habitually influenced by the
active energy of the other : whence then had arisen
Mr. Boohester's dismay when he heard of Mr. Mason's
atrinl? Why bad the mere name of this onresistiDg

The candle, wasted at last» went oat; ss it expired, I
perceived streaks of grey fight edging the window curtains :

revived. Nor was it unwarranted : in fiye minutes more the
gndsg kev, the yielding lock, warned me my wateh waa

Mr. Boehester entered, and with him the s ur geon he hsd

surprised and cheered to see bow far dawn was advanced:
what rosy streaks vrere beginning to brighten the east. Then
he approached Mason, whom the surgeon was alread;
handling.
'Now, my good fellow, how are you ?'he asked.
'She's done for me, I fear,'was the faint reply.
• Not a whit I— courage I This day fortnight you'll hardly
be a pin the worse of it : yoa've lost a little blood ; that's all
Carter, assure him there's no danger.'
'I can do that conscientiously,'Baid Carter, who had now
aodone the bandages ;'only I wish I could have got here
sooner; he would not have bled so much — but how is this?
The flesh on the shoulder Is torn as well as cut. This
wound was not done with a knife : there have been teeth
herel'
'She bit me,'he murmured.'She worried me like a
tigress, when Rochester got the knife from her.'
'You should not have yielded : you should have grappled
with her at once,'said Mr. Rochester.
'But under such circumstances, what could one do?'
returned Mason.'Oh, it was frightful I'he added, shudder-
ing.'And I did not expect it : she looked so quiet at firGt'
'I warned you,'was his friend's answer ;'I said^be on
your guard when you go near her. Besides, you might have
waited till to-morrow, and had me with you: it was mere
tolly to attempt the interview to-night and alone.'
'1 thought t could have done some good.'
'You thought 1 you thought I Yes ; it makes me
impiticnt to hear you : but, however, you have suffered, and
are likely to suffer enough for not taking my advice ; so I'll
say no more. Carter— hurry 1 — hurry 1 The sun will soon
rise, and I must have him off.'
'Directly, air ; the shoulder is just bandaged. I must
look to this other wound in the arm : she has had her teelb
here too, I think.'
'She sucked the blood : she said she'd drain my heart,'
said Mason.

I flew thither and back, bringing the desired vossels.
'That's well I Mow, doctor, I shall take the liberty of

He held out the tiny glass, and I half filled it from the
water bottle on the wash-stand.
'That will do— now wet the lip of the phial.'
I did so : be measured twelve drops of a orimson liquid,
and presented it to Mason.

Mr. Boohester, aa he dosed and barred the heavy yard-gates.
This done, he moved with slow etep and abstracted air
towards a door in the wall bordering the orchard. I, sup-
posing he had done with me, prepared to return to the
houae ; again, however, I beard him call'Jane 1'He had
opened the portal and stood at it, waiting (or me.
'Come where there is some freshness, for a few moments,'
he sEbid;'that honse is a mere dungeon : don't yoa feel it
90?'
'It seems to me a splendid man^on, sir.'
'The glamour of inexperience is over your eyes,'ha
answered ;'and yon see it through a charmed medium : you
cannot discern that the gilding is slime and the silk draperies
cobwebs : that the marble is sordid slate, and the polished
noods mere refuse chips and scaly bark. Now here'(he
pointed to the leafy enclosure we had entered)'all is real,
sweet, and pure.'
He strayed down a walk edged with box; with apple
trees, pear trees, and cherry trees on one side, and a border
on the other, full of all sorts of old-fashioned flowers, stocks,
sweet-williams, primroses, pansies, mingled with southern-
wood, sweet-briar, and various fragrant herbs. They were
tnth DOW as a sncoession of April showers and gleams,
followed by % lovely spring morning, could make them : the
sun was just entering the dappled east, and his light illumined
the wreathed and dewy orchard trees and shone down the
quiet walka under them.
'Jane, wiUy.a have a flower 7'
He gathered a half-blown rose, the Brat on the bash, and
ofEared it to me.
'Thank yon, m.'
'Do you like this sunrise, Jane ? That sky with its high
and hght clouds which are sure to melt away aa the day

'Precisely : I see yoa do. I see ganuine contentment in

characteristically say,'all that is right': for if I bid you do

'If you have no more to fear from Mr. Mason than yon

'God grant it may be so I Here, Jane, is an arboor ; sit

The arbour was an arch in the wall, lined with ivy ; it

however, for me : but I stood betora him.

CHAPTER XXI
Fbxssmtiubkts ara strange tbioga I and so are Bympatbtea ;
and so are aigna : and the three combined make one mystery
to which hamnnity haa not yet found the key. I never
laughed at presentiments in my life ; because I have had
strange ones of my own. Sympathies, I believe, exist : (for
instance, between far-distant, long-absent, Tvholly estranged
relatives; asserting, notwithstanding their alienation, the
nnity of the source to which each traces his origin) whose
workings baffle mortal comprehension. And signs, toraaght
we know, may be but the sympathies of Nature ^th man.
When I wae a little girl, only six years old, I, one night,
heard Bessie Leaven say to Martha Abbot that she bad been
dreaming about a little child ; and that to dream of children
was a sure sign of trouble, either to one's self or one's Mn.
The saying might have worn out of my memory, bad not a
circumstance immediately followed which served indelibly to
fix it there. The next day Besme was sent for home to the
deathbed of her little rist^.
Of late I had often recalled this saying and this inddent ;
for during the past week scarcely a night had gone over my
couch that bad not brought with it a dream of an infant :
which I sometimes hushed in my arms, sometimes dandled
on my knee, sometimes watched playing with daisies on ft
lawn ; or again, dabbling its hands in ranning water. li
was a wailing child this night, and a laughing one the next:
now it nestled close to me, and now it ran from me ; but
whatever mood the apparition evinced, whatever aspect it
wore, it fuled not for seven snccesnTe nights to meet me
the moment I entered the land of slomber.

I did nol lilDe this itermtioD ol one ideft — this Strugs

from oompsnionship with this bsby-phsntom I had been
roused on that moonlight night when I heard the ery ; and
U was on the afternoon ol the day following I was sommoned
downstairs by a message that some one wanted me in Mrs.
Fairfax's room. On repairing thither. Ifoondaman waiting
for me, having the appearanoe ol a gentleman's servant : he
was dressed in deep monming, and the hat he held in Us
hand was sorroanded with a craps band.
'I daresay yon hardly remember me, miss,* he said, rittng
as I entered; * bat my name is Leaven : I lived #v > ifcAlitw^i^
with Mrs. Beed when yon were at Gateshead eigjht or nine
years since, and I live there stilL'
'Oh, Bobert I how do yon do? I remember you very
well: yon nsed to give me a ride sometimes on Ifllss
Georgiana's bay pony. And how is Bessie? Yon are

'Tes, miss: my wife is very hearty, thank yon; she-
brought me another little one about two months since we
have three now — and both mother and child are thriving.*
'And are the family well at the house, Bobert 7'
'I am sorry I can't give you better nevre of them, nuas :
they are very badly at present — in great trouble.'
'I hope no one is dead,'I said glancing at his Uaok drees.
He too looked down at the crape round his hat and replied,
—'Mr. John died yesterday was a week, at his chambere in
London.'
'Mr. John?'
'And how does his mother bear it?'
'Why you see. Miss Eyre, it is not a common mishap :
his life has been very wild : these last three yean he gave him-

old companions and habits. His head was not strong : the
knaves be lived amongst fooled him beyond anything I
ever he & rd. Ho came down to Gateshead about three weeks
Bigo and wanted missus to give up all to him. Missis refused :
her means have long been much reduced by his eitravagance ;
BO he went back again, and the next news was that he was
dead. How he died, God knovrs 1 — tbey say he killed him-
*elf.-
I wassilent: the tidings were fnghtful. Bobert Leaven ra-
mmed : —'Missis had been out of health herself for some time :
she bad got very stoat, hut was not strong with it ; and the loss
of money and fear of poverty were qaite breaking her down.
The information about Mr. John's death and the manner of
it came too suddenly : it brought on a stroke. She was three
days without speaking ; but last Tuesday she seemed rather
better : she appeared as if she wanted to say something, and
kept making sgns to my wife and mumbling. It was only
yesterday morning, however, that Bessie understood she
yna pronouncing your name ; and at last she mode out the
words, " Bring Jane — fetch Jane Byre : I want to speak
to her. " Bessie is not snie whether she is in her
right mind, or means anything by the words ; but she told
Miss Beed and Mies Georgiana, and advised them to send
tor yoo. The young ladies pat it off at first: but their
mother grew so restless, and said, " Jane, Jane, " so many
times, that at last they consented. I left Gateshead yester-
day ; and if yon can get ready, miss, I should hke to take
yon back widi me early to-morrow moming.'
'Tee, Bobert, I shall he ready: it seems to me that I
ooghttogo.'

the servants* hall, and reoommended bim to the oaca ol
John's wife, and the attentions oi John himself, I went in
search of Mr. Bochester.
He was not in any of the lower rooms ; he was not in the
yard, the stables, or the grounds. I asked Mrs. Eairfax if
she had seen him; — ^yes: she beUered he was playing
billiards with Miss Ingram. To the Ulliard-room I hastened :
the click of balls and the hum of Yoioes. resounded thenoe :
Mr. Bochester, Miss Ingram, the two IGsses Eshton, and
their admirers, were all busied in the game. It required
some courage to disturb so interesting a party ; my errand,
however, was one I could not defer, so I approaohed the
master where he stood at Miss Ingram's side. She turned
as I drew near and looked at me haughtily : her eyes g^med
to demand,'What can the creeping oreature want now?'
and when I said, in a low voice,'Mr. Bochester,* she made
a movement as if tempted to order me away. I remember
her appearance at the moment, — ^it was very graceful and
very striking : she wore a morning robe of sky-blue crape ;
a gauzy azure scarf was twisted in her hair. She had beea
all animation vnth the game, and irritated pride did not
lower the expression of her haughty lineamento.
'Does that person want you?'she inquired of Mr.
Bochester ; and Mr. Bochester turned to see who the * person'
was. He made a curious grimace, — one of his strange and
equivocal demonstrations^^threw down his cue and followed
me from the room.
'Well, Jane 7'he said, as he rested his back against the
schoolroom door, which he had shut.
'If you please, sir, I want leave of absenoe.for a week or
two.'
• What to do?— Where to go ? •
'To see a sick lady who has sent for me.*

house : and to these details Bessie listened with intereei:
they were precisely of the kind she relished.
In such conversation an hour was soon gone : Beane
restored to me my bonnet^ & c, and, accompanied by her, I
quitted the lodge for the haU. It was also accompanied by
her that I had, nearly nine years ago, walked down the path,
I was now ascending. On a dark, misty, raw morning ia
January, I had left a hostile roof with a desperate sod
embittered heart — a sense of outlawry and almost of
reprobation — to seek the chilly harbourage of Lowood : thit
bourne so bur away and unexplored. The same hostile roof
now again rose before me : my prospects were doubtful yet;
and I had yet an aching heart. I still felt as a wanderer oo
the face of the earth ; bulb I experienced firmer trost^n
myself and my own powers, and less withering dread of
oppression. The gaping wound of my wrongs, too, was now
quite healed ; and the flame of resentment extinguished.
'You bhall go into the breakfast-room first,'said Bem
as she preceded me through the hall ;'the young ladies wiD'
be there.'
In another moment I was within that apartment, lliem
was every article of furniture looking just as it did oo the
morning I was first introduced to Mr. Brocklehurst : the very
rug he had stood upon still covered the hearth. Gknoing
at the book-cases, I thought I could distinguish the two
volumes of'BcNvick's British Birds'occupying their old plaoe
on the third shelf, and'Gulliver's Travels* and the * Arabian
Nights'ranged just above. The inanimate objects weie not
changed : but the living things had altered past recognitioQ.
Two young ladies appeared before me; one very tall,
almost as tall as Miss In^pram, — very thin too, with a saUow
■

face and severe mien. There was something iLscetic ia her
look, which was augmented by the extreme plainness of a
straight- skirted, hiack, stuff dress, a starched lineu collar,
hair combed away from the temples, and the nun -like ornament
of a string of ebony beads and a crucifix. This I felt sure
was Eliza, though I could trace little resemblance to her
former self in that elongated and colourless visage.
The other was as certainly Georgiana : but not the
Georgiana I remembered — the slim and fairy-Uke girl of eleven.
This was a full-blown, very plump damsel, fair as wax-work ;
with handsome and regular features, languishing blue eyes,
and ringleted yellow h»r. The hue of her dress was black
too ; but its fashion was so different from her sister's — so
macb more flowing and becoming— it looked as stylish as
the other's looked puritanicaL
In each of the sisters there was one trait of the mother —
and only one : the thin and pallid elder daughter had her
parent's Cairngorm eye : the blooming and luxuriant
younger girl had her contour of jaw and chin, — perhaps a
little softened, but still imparting an indescribable hardness
to the countenance, otherwise so voluptuous and buxom.
Both ladies, as I advanced, rose to welcome me, and both
addressed me by the nama of'Miss Eyre.'Eliza's greeting
TTH delivered in a short, abrupt voics, without a smile ; and
then she sat down again, fixed her eyes on the fire, and
■eemed to forget me. Georgiana added to her'How d'ye
do?'Mveral common-places about my journey, Uie weather
and to on, ottered in rather a drawling tone : and aooom-
panied by nindry side-glanoes that measored me from head
to foot — now traversing the folds of my drab merino pelisse,
and now lingering on the plain trimming of my cottage
bonnet. Toang ladies have a remarkable way of letting yon
know that they think you a'quis'without actually saying
the words. A certain superciliousness of look, coolness o(
manner, nonchalance of tone, express fnlly their sentiments
on the ptrint, without committing them by any poeitiTS nide-
nan in word or deed.

A sneer, however, whether covert or open, had now no
longer that power over me it onoe poeseseed: as I nl
between my oouwns, I was surprised to find how easy I leb
under the total neglect of the one and the semi-saroastie
attentions of the other— Eliaa did not mortify, nor Oeoigiana
ruffle me. The fact was, I had other things to think about;
within the last few months feelings had been stirred in me
so much more potent than any they could raise — pains and
pleasures so much more acute and exquisite had been ex c itedt
than any it was in their power to inflict or bestow — thai
their airs gave me no concern either for good or bad.
'How is Mrs. Beed ?'I asked soon, looking calmly al
Georgiana ; who thought fit to bridle at the direct addresst
as if it were an unexpected liberty.
'Mrs. Beed? Ah I mama you mean; she is eztremdy
poorly : I doubt if you can see her to-night'
'If/ said I,'you would just step upstairs and tell ber I
am come, I should be much obliged to you.'
Georgiana almost started, and she opened her bine eyes
wild and wide.'I know she had a particular wish to see
me/ I added,'and I would not defer attending to her desire
longer than is absolutely necessary/
'Mama dislikes being disturbed in an evening,'remarked
Eliza. I soon rose, quietly took off my bonnet and gloves,
uninvited, and said I would just step out to Bessie — ^who
was, I dared say, in the kitchen — and ask her to ascertain
whether Mrs. Beed was disposed to receive me or noi to-
night. I went, and having found Bessie and despatched ber
on my errand, I proceeded to take further measures. It had
heretofore been my habit always to shrink from arrogance :
received as I had been to-day, I should, a year ago, have re-
solved to quit Gateshead the very next morning; now, it
was disclosed to me all at once, that that would be a foolish
plan. I had taken a journey of a hundred miles to see my
aunt, and I must stay with her till she was better— or dead :
as to her daughters'pride or folly, I must put it on one side;
make m}'8elf independent of it. So I addressed the house-
378 JANB ETBB
beeper : asked her to show me a room, told her I should pro-
bably be a vieitor hera for a week or two, had my trunk con-
veyed to my chamber, and followed it thither myself : I met
Bessie on the landing.
'Missis is awake,'said she ;'I have told her yon are
here : come and let us see if she will know yon.'
I did not need to bo guided to the well-known room : to
which I bad so often been summoned for chastisement or
reprimand in former days. I hastened before Bessie, I softly
opened the door : a shaded light stood on the table, tor it was
now getting dark. There wag (he great four-post bed with
amber hangings as of old : there the toilet-table, the arm-
chair, and the foot-stool : at which I had a hundred times
been sentenced to kneel, to ask pardon for offences, by me,
uncommitted. I looked into a certain corner near, half-
expecting to see the slim outline of a once-dreaded switch ;
which used to luvk there, waiting to leap out imp-like and
lace my quivering palm or shrinking neck. I approached
the bed ; I opened the curtains and leant over the high-piled
pillows.
Well did I remember Mrs. Beed'a face, and I eagerly
•ought ths familiar image. It ia a happy thing that time
quells the longinga of vengeance, and hushes the promptings
ci rage and avernon : I had left this wom & a in luttemesB and
bate, and I oame back to her now with no other emotion than
» aort of mth for her great sufferings, and a strong yearning
to forget and for^ve all injuries — to be reconciled and clasp
bands in unity.
The well-known face was there : stem, relentless as ever
'— there was that peculiar eye whioh nothing oonld melt;
and the somewhat raised, imperious, despotic eyebrow. How
often had it lowered on me menace and hate I and how the
reoc^ection of childhood's terrors and sorrows ravived as I
traced its harsh line now t And yet I stooped down and
kissed her : she looked at me.
'Is this Jane Eyre ?'she said.

disk ; a group of reeds and wateT > flags, and a naiad's head
crowned with lotus-flowers, rising out ol them ; an elf sitting
in a hedge-sparrow's nest, under a wreath of hawthorn-
bloom.
One morning I fell to sketching a face : what sort of a
face it was to be, I did not care or know. I took a eoft
black pencil, gave il a broad point, and worked away. Soon
I had traced on the paper a broad and prominent forehead,
and a square lower outline of visage : that contour gave me
pleasure; myfingers proceeded actively to fill it with features.
Strongly -marked horizontal eyebrows must be traced under
that brow ; then followed, naturally, a well-defined nose,
with a straight ridge and full nostrils ; then a flexible-looking
mouth, by no means narrow ; then a firm chin, with a
decided cleft down the middle of it : of course, some black
whiskers were wanted, and some jetty hair, tufted on the
temples, and waved above the forehead. Now for the eyes :
I had left them to the last, because they required the most
careful working. I drew them large ; I shaped them well :
the eyelashes I traced long and sombre ; the irids luatroua
and large.'Good I but not quite the thing,'I thonght, as I
Burreyed the effect :'They want more force and spirit ;'
and I wrought the shades blacker, that the lights might flash
more brilliantly — a happy touch or two eeoured sucoess.
There, I had a friend's face under my gaze ; and what did it
* aignify that those young ladies turned their backs on me?
I looked at it ; I smiled at the speaking likeness : I was
absorbed and oonteuL
'Is that a portrait of some one you know ?'asked Eliza,
who had approached me unnoticed. I responded that it
was merely a fancy head, and burned it buieath the other
sheets. Ot course, I lied: it was, in fact, a very faithful
represeotatioD of Mr. Bochester. But what was that to her,
or to any one but myself 7 Georgiana also advanoed to look.
The other drawings pleased her much, but she called that'an

outline. Then (}eorgiana prodaoed her anmm. I piomiaed
to contribute a vrater-colour drawing : this pat her at onos
into good humour. She proposed a walk in the gromids.
Before we had been out two hours^ we were deep in a oon-
fidential conversation: she had favoured ma with a
description of the brilliant winter she had spent in Tondon
two seasons ago — of the admiration she had there excited —
the attention she had received : and I even got hints of the
titled conquest she had made. In the course of the afternoon
and evening these hints were enlarged on : various soft
conversations were reported, and sentimental scenes repre-
sented; and, in short, a volume of a novel of fashionable
life was that day improvised by hier for my benefit The
communications were renewed from day to day : they always
ran on the same theme — ^herself, her loves, and woes. It
was strange she never once adverted either to her mother^s
illness, or her brother's death, or the present gloomy state of
the family prospects. Her mind seemed wholly taken up
with reminiscences of past gaiety, and aspirations after dis-
sipations to come. She passed about five minutes each day
in her mother's sick-room and no more.
Eliza still spoke little : she had evidently no time to talk.
I never saw a busier person than she seemed to be : yet it
was difficult to say what she did : or rather, to discover
any result of her diligence. She had an alarum to call her
up early. I know hot how she occupied herself before
breakfast, but after that meal she divided her time into
regular portions; and each hour had its allotted task.
Three times a day she studied a little book, which I found,
on inspection, was a Gonmion Prayer-book. I asked her
once what was the great attraction of that volume, and she
said'the Bubric'Three hours she gave to stitching, with
gold thread, the border of a square crimson cloth, almost
large enough for a carpet. In answer to my inquiries after
the use of this article, she informed me it was a covering for
the altar of a new church lately erected near Gateshead.
Two hours she devoted to her diary; two to working by

herself in tba kitcheD-garden ; a,nd oae to the reguIatioQ of
her accounts. She seemed to want no company ; do cou-
versatioQ. I believe she was happy in her way : ihia routine
sufficed to her ; and nothing aanoyed her so much as the
occurrence of any incident which forced her to vary its clock-
work regularity.
She told me one evening, when more disposed to be
eommunicaUve than usual, that John's conduct, and the
threatened ruin of the family, had been a source of profound
EifflictioQ to her : but she had now, she said, settled her
mind, and formed her resolution. Her own fortune she had
taken care to secure ; and when her mother died, — and it
was wholly improbable, she tranquilly remarked, that sbe
Bhould either recover or linger long, — sbe would execute a
long-cherished project: seek a retirement where punctual
habits would be permanently secured from disturbance, and
place safe barriers between herself and a frivolous world, I
Mked if Georgiana would accompany her.
'Of course not. Georgiana and she had nothing io
common : they never had had. She would not be burdened
with her society for any consideration. Geoi^ana shonld
take her own oourse ; and she, Eliza, would take hen.'
Georgiana, when not unburdening her heart to me, spent
most of her time in lying on the sofa, fretting about the
dulness of the house, and wishing over and over again that
her aunt Gibson would send her an invitation up to town.
'It would be so much better,'she said,'it she could ouly
get oat of the way for a month or two, till oU was over.'I
did not ask what she meant by'all being over,'bat I Buppoes
she referred to the expected decease of ber mother and tiie
gloomy sequel of funeral rites. Ehza generally took no mere
notioe of her sister's indolence and complaints than if no
BOob mormnring, loanging object had been before her. Ooe
day, however, as she put away her aoooont book, and un-
folded ber embroidery, she suddenly took her op thai :—

right to be born : for you make no nee ci life. Instead ol
living for, in, and with yourself, as a reasonable being oo^
you seek oiily to fasten your feebleness on some other
person's strength : if no one can be foand willing to burden
her or himself with such a fat, weak, pufiy, useless thing,
you cry out that you are ill-treated, neglec t ed, miserable.
Then, too, existence for you must be a scene of continual
change and excitement, or else the world is a dungeon : you
must be admired, you must be courted, you most be flatteied
— ^you must have music, dancing, and society— or you
languish, you die away. Have you no sense to devise a
8)*stem which will make you independent of all eSaria, and
all wills, but your own? Take one day; share it into
sections ; to each section apportion its task : leave no stray
unemployed quarters of an hour, ten minutes, five minutes,
include all; do each piece of business in its turn with
method, with rigid regularity. The day will dose almost
before you are aware it has begun ; and you are indebted to
no one for helping you to get rid of one vacant moment ; yon
have had to s^ no one's company, conversation, sympathy,
forbearance: you have lived, in short, as an independent
being ought to do. Take this advice : the first and last I
shall offer you ; then you will not want me or anyone else,
happen what may. Neglect it — go on as heretofore, craving,
whining, and idling — and suffer the results of your idiocy,
however bad and insufferable they may be. I tell you this
plainly ; and listen : for though I shall no more repeat what
I am now about to say, I shall steadily act on it. After my
mother's death, I wash my hands of you : from the day hcdr
coffin is carried to the vault in Gateshead Church, you and
I will be as separate as if we had never known each other.
You need not think that because we chanced to be bom of
the same parents, I shall suffer you to fasten me down by
even the feeblest claim ; I can tell you this — if the whole
human race, ourselves excepted, were swept away, and we
two stood alone on the earth, I would leave you in the old
world, and betake myself to the new.'

She closed ber lips.
'You might have spared yourself ihe trouble of deliveriog
that tirade,'answered Gcoigiana.'Everybody knows
you are the most selGsh, heartless creature in existence:
and I know your spitefol hatred towards me; I have
had a specimen of it before in the trick you played me
about Lord Edwin Vere : you could not bear me to be
raised above you, to have a title, to be received into circleB
where you dare not show your face, and bo you acted the
spy and ioformor, and ruined my prospects for ever.'
Georgiana took out her handkerchief and blew her nose tor
an hour afterwards; Eliza sat cold, impassible, and
asnduously industrioua.
True, generous feeling is made small account of by some :
but here were two Qatures rendered, the one intolerably acrid,
the other despicably saTOurless for the want of it. Feeling
without judgment is a washy draught indeed ; but judg-
ment ontempered by feeling is too bitter and husky a moreel
for human deglutition.
It wa« a wet and windy afternoon : Georgiana had fallen
asleep on the sofa over the perusal of a novel ; Eliza was
gone to attend a saint's-daj servioa at the new ohorofa— for
in matters of reli^on she was a rigid formallet : no weather
ever prevented the punctual discharge of what ehs coa-
eidered her devotional duties : fair or foul, she went to
church thrice every Sunday, and as often on week-^yi u
there weio prayers.
I bethought myself to go npstura and see how the dying
woman sped, who lay there almost unheeded: the vei?
servants paid her but a remittent attention : the hired nurse,
bong lit^ looked after, would slip out of the room whenever
■be could. Bessie was faithful ; but she had her own familj
to nund, and could only come occasionally to the halL I

Mb. R0CBE8TSB had giveo me but one week's leave of
absence: yet a montb elapsed before I quitted Gateshead.
I wished to leave immediately after the funeral ; bat
Georgiana entreated me to stay till she could get off to
London : whither she was now at last invited by her uncle,
Mr. Gibson; who bad come down to direct his sistfr's
inteimeot and settle the family aff^rs. Georgiana said she
dreaded b^ng left alone with Eliza ; from her she got ueither
sympathy in her dejection, support in her fears, nor aid in her
preparations ; sol bore with her feeble-minded quailings, and
selfish lamentations, as well as I could, and did my best is
sewing tor her. and packing hei dresses. It is true that
while I worked she would idle ; and I thought to myself,
'If yoa and I were destined to Uve always together, conait,
we would oommenoe matters on a different footing. I
sboold not settle tamely down into being the forbearing
party; I should assign you your share of labour, uid
compel you to acoomplish it, or else it should be left
undone : I should insist, also, on your keeping some of those
drawling, half-insinoere complaints bushed in your own
breast It is only becaose our connection happens to be
very tranutory, and comes at a peculiarly mournful season,
that I consent thus to tender it so patient and compliant on
my part'
At last I saw Georjpana off ; but now it was Elia'i turn
to request me to stay another week. Her plans required sU
her time and attention, she asid : she was about to deput
tta some unknown bourne ; and a11 day long she stayed in

bock to Gateshead when a child, after a long walk— to be
scolded for looking cold or gloomy; and later, what it was
to come back from church to Lowood — to long for a plen-
teous meal and a good fire, and to be uuabla to get dther.
Neither of these retumings were very pleasant or
desirable : no magnet drew me to a given point, increadag
- in its strength o( attraction the nearer I came. The return
to Tbomfield was yet to be tried.
My journey seemed tedious — very tedious : fifty miles
one day, a ntght spent at an tnn ; fifty miles the nest day.
During the first twelve hours I thought of Mrs. Reed in her
last moments : I saw her disfigured and discoloured face,
and beard her strangely altered voice. I mused on the
funeral day, the coffin, the hearse, the black train of tenants
and servants^few was the number of relatives — the gaping
vault, the silent church, the solemn service. Then I thought
of Eliza and Geor^na: I beheld one the cynosure of %
ball-room, the other the inmate of a convent cell : and I
dwelt on and analysed their separate peculiarities of person
and character. The evening arrival at the great town of
scattered these thoughts ; night gave them quite another
turn : laid down on my traveller's bed, I left reminisoenoe
for antidpation.
I " was going back to Tbomfield : but how long was I to
itay there ? Not long ; of that I was sture. I had heard
bom Mrs. Fairfax in the interim of my absenoe : the party
at the hall was dispersed; Mr. Boohester bad left for
London three weeks ago, but he was then expected to retnm
in a fortnight Mrs. Fairfax surmised that he was gone le

purcbanng a new carriage : she said the idea of bis mairying
Miss Ingram still seemed strange to her ; but from what
everybody sud, and from what she had herself seen, sha
could no longer doubt that the event would shortly take
place.'You would be strangely incredulous if yon did
doubt it,'was my mental comment'I don't doubt it.'
The question followed,'Where was I to go ?'I dreamt

And tbeo I strangled a new'bom agony — & deformed thing
which I could not persuade myself to own and rear— and
nui on.
They are making hay, too, in Thornfield meadows : or,
rather, the labourers are just quitting their work, and re-
turning home with their rakes on their shoulders : now, at
the hour I arrive. I have but a field or two to traverse, snd
then I shall cross the road and reach the gates. How lull
the hedges are of roses I But I have no time to gather any ;
I want to be at the house. I passed a tall briar, shooting
leafy and flowery branches across the path ; I see the
narrow stile with stone steps; and I see — Mr. Bochestei
sitting there, a book and a pencil in his hand : he is writing.
Well, he is not a ghost ; yet every nerve I have is nn-
strung : for a moment I am beyond my own mastery. What
does it mean ? I did not think I should tremble in this way
when I saw him — or lose my voice or the power of motion
in his presenc*. I will go back as soon as I can stir : I need
not make an absolute fool of myself. I know another vvj
to the house. It does not ugnify if I Icoew twenty ways;
for he has seen me.
■ HiUo 1'he cries ; and be puts up hia book and hit
penciL'There yoa are I Come on, if you please.'
I suppose I do oome on ; though in what fashion I know
not: b^ng scarcely cognisant of my moremente, and
solicitous only to appear calm ; and, above all, to control the
working muscles of my face — which I feel rebel insolently
against my will, and struggle to express what I had resolved
to conceal. But I have a veil — it is down : I may make shift
yet to behave with decent composare.
• And this is Jane Eyre ? Are yoa coming from MUloote,
and on foot ? Yes — ^jnst one of your tricks : not to send for
a carriage, and oome clattering over street and road like a
common mortal, but to steal into the vicinage of your hoiDB
along witli twilight, just as if yoa were a dream or a shade.
What the deuce have yoa done with yourself this last
month?'

Buoh yoa are handsome enough ; or mther, yoni Btenmwt
has ft power beyond beauty.'
Ht. Bochester had gomelimes read my unspoken thoughts
with an acumen to me incomprehensible : in the present
instance he took no notice of my abrupt vocal response ; but
he smiled at me with a certajn smile be had of his own, and
which he used but on rare occasions. He seemed to think
it too good for common purposes : it was tba real sunshine
of feeling — he shed it over me now.
'Pass, Janet,'said he, making room for me to cross the
stile :'go np home, and stay your weary little wandeiiog
feet at a friend's threshold.'
All I had now to do was to obey him in silence : no need
for me to coUoqutse further. I got over the stile without &
. word, and meant to leave him calmly. An impulse held me
fast, — a force turned me round. I said— or something ia
me said for me, and in spite of me : —
'Thank you, Mr. Rochester, for your great Mndness. I
am strangely glad to get bock again to you; and wherever
you are is my home — my only home.'
I walked on so fast that even he could hardly have orer-
laken me had he tried. Little Addle was half vn\d vdih
deUgbt when she saw me. Mrs. Fairfax recdved me with
her osnal plain friendliuew. Leah smiled ; and even Sophie
Ind me'boo loir'with glee. This was very pleasant : there
u no happiness like that of being loved by your fellow-
oreaturee, and feeling that your presence it an additioa to
their oomfort
I, that evening, shut my eyea resolutely against the
future : I stopped my ears against the voice that kept warn-
ing me of near separation and coming grief. When tea vni
over and Mrs. Kurfax had token her knitting, and I had
asBiimed a low seat near her, and Adftle, kneeling on the
carped had nestled dose np to me, and a eenee of mnta*l
afleotios seemed to surround ua with a ring of golden peace,
I uttered a slent prayer that we might not ha parted far «
toon; but when, as we thus sat, Mr. Boohester entered,

unannoonoed, and looldng at ns, seemed (o take pleasure in
'the spectacle of a group so amicable — ^when he said he vof-
^ posed the old lady was all right now that she had got her
: adopted daughter back again, and added that he saw Adils
\ was'pr6te 4 croquer sa petite maman Anglaise'— ^I haU
ventured to hope that he would, even after his DEianiagab
keep us together somewhere under the shelter of his pio-
toction, and not quite exiled from the sunshine of his
presence.
A fortnight of dubious calm succeeded my letom to
Thornfield HalL Nothing was said of the master's maniags,
and I saw no preparation going on for such an sTont.
Almost every day I asked Mrs. Fairfax if she had yet heard
anything decided : her answer was always in the negative.
Once, she said, she had actuaUy put the question to Mr.
Rochester as to when he was going to bring his bride
home ; but he had answered her only by a joke, and one
of his queer looks, and she could not tell what to make of
him. «
One thing specially surprised me, and that was, there
were no joumeyings backward and forward, no visitB to
Ingram Park : to be sure it was twenty miles ofi^ on the
borders of another county ; but what was that distance to
^ an ardent lover? To so practised and indefatigable a horse-
! man as Mr. Bochester it would be but a morning's ride. I
began to cherish hopes I had no right to conceive : that the
match was broken off; that rumour had been mistaken;
I that one or both parties had changed their minds. I used
- to look at my master's face to see if it were sad or fieroe ;
^ but I could not remember the time when it had been so
\ uniformly clear of clouds or evil feelings. If, in the moments
j I and my pupil spent vnth him, I lacked spirits and sank
into inevitable dejection, he became even gay. Never had
he called me more frequently to his presence; never been
. kinder to me when there— and, alas I never had I loved hhn

A BFLSNoro Midsiunmer ehone over England : sMes bo pore,
Stma BO radiant as were then seen in long succession, seldom
. favour, even singly, our wave-girt land. It vfas as if a band
of Italiau days had come from the South, Uke a flock of
glorious passenger birds, and Ughted to rest them on the
eliffs of Albion. The hay was all got in ; the fields round
Thornfield were green and shorn ; the roads white sod
baked ; the trees were in their dark prime ; hedge and wood,
full-leaved and deeply tinted, contrasted well with the sunny
hue of the cleared meadows between.
On Midsummer -eve, AdSle, weary with gathering wild
Btrawberries in Hay Lane half the day, had gone to bed with
the sun. I watched her drop asleep, and when I left her I
■ought the garden.
It wai now the sweetest hour of the twenty-tonr : —'Day
its fervid fires hod wasted,'aud dew fell cool on panting plain
and Boorcbed summit. Where the sun had gone down io
aimple state — pure of the pomp of clouds — spread a solemn
purple, burning with the light of red jewel and furnace flams
at one pcnnt, on one hill-peak, and extending high and wide,
soft and still softer, over half heaven. The east had its own
oharm of fine, deep blue, and its own modest gem, a rising
»nd solitary star : soon it woold boast the moon ; but she
was yet beneath the horison.
I walked a while on the pavement ; but a subtle, well-
known scent— that of a cigar — stole from some window; In*
the library casement open a handbreath ; I knew I might k
watched thence ; so I went apart into the orchard. No nook
in the grounds more sheltered and more Eden-like ; it vu

horse-chesurat, circled si the bsse by a po s t, led down to
the fence. Here one coold wmnder unseen. While sndi
honey-dew fell, such silence r»gned, soch gloaming gathered,
I f el; as if I coold hsnnt soch shsde for eyer : bat in thresd*
bg the flower and froit parterres at the npper part of the
inclosore. enticed there by the light the now-risiiig nsooo
casu oa this more open qoarter. my step is stayed — ^not by
sound, not by sight, bat once more by a warning fragrance.
Sweet briar and sonthemwood, jasmine, pink, and rose*
bive long been yielding their evening sscrifice of inoense :
:h!3 new scent is neither of shrob nor flower; it is — ^I know
h well — it is Mr. Bochester's cigar. I look loond, and I
lis:en. I see trees laden with ripening frnit. I hear a
nighdngale warbling in a wood half a mUe off; no moving
form is visible, no coming step aodible ; bat that perfume
increases : I mast flee. I make for the wicket leading to the
shnibbervp and I see Mr. Bochester entering. I step aside
into the ivy recess; he will not stay long: he will soon
return whence he came, and if I sit still he will never see me.
Bat no— eventide is as pleasant to him as to me, and this
indque garden as attractive ; and he strolls on, now lifting
the gooseberry tree branches to look at the frait, large as
plums, with which they are laden ; now taking a ripe cherry
f :*om the wall ; now stooping towards a knot of flowers, either
V3 inhale their fragrance or to admire the dew-beads on their
petals. A great moth goes hamming by me ; it alights on a
plant at Mr. Bochester's foot: he sees it, and bends to
examine it.
*Now he has his back towards me,* thought I, * and he
'is occupied too ; perhaps, if I walk softly, I can slip away
j annotioed.'
I trod on an edging of turf that the crackle of the pebUy

JANE EYBB
gravel might not betray me: be was standing among ib.i
beds ftt a yard or two distant from where I had to pass ; tin
moth apparently engaged him.'I shall get by very well,'I
medit & ted. As I crossed his 8ha4ow, thro^%-D long over the
g & rden by the moon, not yet risen high, he said quietly
without turning: —'Jane, come and look at this fellow.'
I biid made no noise : be had not eyes behind— «)u]d iae
shadow feel 7 I started at first, and then I approached him.
'Look at bis wings,'said he ;'be reminds me rather of s
West Indian insect ; one does not often see so large and gay
a night-rover in England : there I he is flown.'
The moth roamed away. I was sheepishly retreating
also ; but Mr. Bochester followed me, and when we reached
the vricket, be said : —'Tnm back : on so lovely a night it is
a shame to sit in the house ; and sarely no one can wish to
go to bed while sunset is thus at meeting with moonrise.'
It is one of my faults that, though my tongue is some-
times prompt enough at an answer, there are times when it
sadly tails me in framing an excuse ; and always the lapse
occurs at some crisis, when a facile word or plausible pretext
is specially wanted to got me out of painful embarraRsment.
I did not like to walk at this hour alone with Mr. Bochester
in the shadowy orchard ; but I oonld not find a reason to
allc^ for leaving him. I followed with lagging step, and
thooghts bumly bent on discovering a means of eztricalioD;
bat be himself looked so composed, and bo grave also, 1
became ashamed of feeling any confnsion : the evil — if evil
enstenk or prospective there was — seeaied to lie with me

In listening, I sobbed convulsively; tor I could repress
what I endured no longer ; I was obliged to yield, and I
was shaken from head to foot with acute distress. When
I did speak, it was only to express an impetuous wish Lhat
I had never been bom, or never come to Thomfield.
,'Because you are sorry to leave it ?'
The vehemence of emotion, stirred by grief and love
within me, was claiming mastery, and struggling for (all
sway; and asserting a right to predominate: to overcome,
to live, rise, and reign at last ; yea, — and to speak.
'I grieve to leave Thornfield : I love Thomfield — I lovt
it, because I have hved in it a full and dehghtful life,—
momentarily at least I have not been trampled on. I
have not been petrified. I have not been buried with inferior
minds, and excluded from every glimpse of Gommunion with
what is bright and energetic, and high. I have talked, face
to face, with what I roveronce ; with what I delight in,—
with an original, a vigorous, an expanded mind. I ban
known yon, Mr. Boohester ; and it strikes me with term
and anguish to feel I absolutely must be torn from you f < x
ever. I see the necesuty of departure ; and it is like looking
on the neoessty of death.'
'Where do you see the neoesnty ?'he asked, mddonly.
'Where ? You, nr, have plaoed it before me.'
'In what shape ?'

'For that fate you have already made your choice, and
must abide by it.'
'Jane, be still a few moments ; you are over-exdted : I
will be still too.'
A waft of wind came sweeping down the laurel walk, and
trembled through the boughs of the chestnut : it wandered
& way— away — to an indefinite distance — it died. The
t nightingale's song was then the only voice of the hour : in
listening to it, I again wept. Mr. Bochester sat quiet, look-
ing at me gently and seriously. Some time passed before
he spoke ; he at last said : —'Come to my side, Jane, and let
us espUJn and understand one another.'
'I will never again come to your side : I am torn away
DOW, and cannot return.'
'But, Jane, I summon you as my wife : it is you only I
intend to marry.'
I was silent : I thought he mocked me.
'Come, Jane— come hither.'

He rose, and vrith a stride reaohed me.

'because my equal is here, and my likeness. Jane, wiU yoa

'God pardoD me I'he subjoined ere long ;'and man

'There is no one to meddle, sir. I have no kindred to

'No — that is the best of it,'he said.
And if I had lored him less I should have thought lua
accent and look ot exultation savage ; but, sitting by himl
roused from the nightmare of parting — called to the
paradise of union — I thought only of the bliss given me to
dnnk in so abundant a flow. Again and again he said,'Are
you happy, Jane ?'And again and again I answered,'Tea.'
After which he murmured,'It will atone — it will atooe.

Bat what had befallen the night? The moon was not
yet set, and wa were all in shadow : I conld scarcely see my
master'a face, near as I wai. And what ailed the chestnttt

laurel walk, and came sweeping over ns.

'And BO,'thought I,'ooold I with yoo.'I should have
said BO, perbape, but a livid, ^vid spark leapt oot of a
aload at which I was looking, and there was a czsok, a czash,
and a dose rattling peal ; and I thought only of hiding my
daasled eyes agunst Mr. Boohester'i shoulder.
The rain rushed down. He hurried me up the walk,
through the grounds, and into the house ; but we were quite
wet before we oonld pass the threshold. He was taking off

effaced every other feeling ; and lood as the wind Uew. near
and deep as the thmider crashed, fierce and frequent as the
lightning gleamed, cataract-like as the rain fell during a
storm of two hoars'dmration, I experienced no fear, and little

of it, to ask if I was safe and tranquil : and that was oomfocti
that was strength for anything.

the reality till I hai i Mr. Bochester again, and heard
him renew his words oi luve and promise.
While arranging my hair, I looked at my face in the glass,
and (eh it was no longer plain : there was hope in ite aspect,
and life in its colour ; and my eyes seemed as if they had
beheld the fount of fruition, and borrowed heams from the
lustrous ripple. I had often been unwilling to took at my
master, because I feared he could not be pleased at my look;
but I was stue I might lift my face to his now, and not cool
his affection by its expression. I took a plain but clean
and light summer dress from my drawer and put it on : it
seemed no attire had ever so well become me; because nooe
bod I ever worn in so blissful a mood.
I was not surprised, when I ran down into the hoU, to
Bee that a brilliant Jane morning had'succeeded to ths
tempest of the night ; and to feel, through the open glan
door, the breathing of a (resh and fragrant breeze. Natnre
must be gladsome when I was bo happy. A beggor-womaii
and her little boy — pale, ragged objects both—were coming
up the walk, and I ran down and gave them all the money
I happened to have in my purse —some three or four
shillinga: good or bad, they must partake of my julxlee.
The rooks cawed, and blither birds sang ; but nothing «u
so merry or so musical as my own rejoicing heart.
Mrs. Fairfax surprised me by looking out of the window
with a sad countenance, and saying gravely : —'Miss Eyn,

I was soon dressed; and when I heard Mr. Bochestei
quit Mrs, Fdrfax's parlour, I hnxried down to it. The old
lady had been reading her morning portion of Scripture—
the lesson for the day ; her Bible lay open before her, iLod
her spectaoles were upon it. Her occupation, suspended by
Mr. Rochester's announcement, seemed now forgotten : her
eyes, fixed on the blank wall opposite, expressed the surprise
of a quiet mind, stirred by unwonted tidings. Seeing roe,
she roused herself : she made a sort of effort to smile, and
framed a few words of congratulation ; but the smile expired,
and the sentence was abandoned unfinished. She put np
her spectacles, shut the Bible, and pushed her chur bulk
from the table.
'I feel BO astonished,'she began,'I hardly know what to

'She is Ur better as she is,'concluded AdMe, after
masing some time:'besides, she would get tired of living
with only you in the moon. If I were mademoiselle, I would
never consent to go with yon,*
'She has consented : she has pledged her word.'
'But you can't get her there : there is no road to the

'Addle, look at that Qeld.'We were now outside Thorn-
field gates, and bowling lightly along the smooth road to
Millcote, where the dust was well-laid by the thunder-stonn,
and where the low hedges and lofty timber trees on each
side gUstened green, and rajn-refreahed.
'In that field, Adfele, I was walking late one evening
about a fortnight since — the evening of the day you helped
me to make hay in the orchard meadows ; and as I was tired
with raking swaths, I sat down to rest me on a stile ; and
there I took out a little book and a pencil, and began to
write about a misfortune Uiat befell me long ago and a wish
I had for happy days to come : I was writing away very fast,
though daylight was fading from the leaf, when something
came ap the path and stopped two yards off me. I looked
at it. It was a little thing with a veil of gossamer on it«
bead. I beckoned it to oome near ms ; it stood soon at my
knee. I never spoke to it, and it never spoke to me, in
words : bat I read its eyes, and it read mine ; and our
■peeohless colloquy was to this effect : — It was a fury, and
oome from Elf-land, it said ; and its errand was to mi^ me
happy : I mnat go with it out ot the common world to a
lonely place — such as the moon, for instance — and it nodded
its head towards her bom, rising over Hay-hill : it told me
ot the alabaster cave and silver vale where we might live. I
•aid I shoald like to go ; but reminded it, as you did me, that
I had nowinge to fly.'

defer it : no — it should be gone through with now. By dini
of entreaties expressed in energetio whispers I reduoed the
half-dozen to two: these, however, he vowed he would
select himself. With anxiety I watched his eye rove over the
gay stores: he fixed on a rioh silk, of the most hrilUaal
amethyst dye, and a superb pink satin. I told him in a new
series of whispers, that he might as well buy me a gold
gown and a silver bonnet at once : I should certainly neiver
venture to wear his choice. With infinite difficulty, for he
was stubborn as a stone, I persuaded him to make an
exchange in favour of a sober black satin and pearl-grej
silk.'It might pass for the present,'he sai4 ; * but he would
yet see me glittering like a parterre.'
Glad was I to get him out of the silk warehouse, and then
out of a jeweller's shop : the more he bought me, the more

As W6 re-entered the carriage, and I eat back feverish and
fagged, I remembered what in the hurry of events, dark and
bright, I had wholly forgotten -—the letter of my uocle,
JoboEjTe, to Mrs. Reed; bis intention toadoptmeand make
me bis legatee.'It would, indeed, be a relief,'I thought,
• if I had ever go small an independency ; I never can bear
being dressed like a doll by Mr. Rochester, or sitting like a
second Danae with the golden sbower falling daily round
me. I vnH write to Madeira the moment I get home, and
tell my nncle John I am going to be married, and to whom :
if I had but a prospect of one day bringing Mr. Rochester
an accession of fortune, I could better endure to be kept by
him now.'And somewhat relieved by this idea (which I
failed not to execute that day), I ventured once moroto meet
my master's and lover's eye ; which most pertinaciously
Bought mine, though I averted both face and gaze. He
amiled ; and I thought his smile was such as a sultan might,

other end of the room, I got Up, and saying,'I wish you
good-aigbt, sir,'in my natural and wonted respectful

The system thus entered on I pursued during the whole
season of probation ; and with the best success. He was
kept, to be sure, rather cross and crusty : but on the whole I
could see he was excellently entertuned ; and that a lamb-
like submission and turtle-dove sensibility, while fostering
his despotism more, would have pleased his judgment,
satisfied his common-senso, and even suited his taste,
less.
In other people's presence I was, as formerly, deferential
and quiet ; any other line of conduct being uncalled for : it
was only in the evening confereuces I thns thwarted and
afflicted bim. He continued to send for me punctually the

arrival were complete. /, at least, had nothing more to do :
there were my trunks, packed, locked, corded, ranged in a
row along the wall of my little chamber : to-morrow, at this
time, they would be far on their road to London : and so
should I (D.V.) > — or rather, not I, but one Jane Rochester, a
person whom as yet I knew not. The cards of address alone
remained to nail on : they lay, four little squares, on the
drawer, Mr. Bochester had himself written the direction,
'Hrs. Bochester, Hotel, London,'on each : I coold
not persnade myself to affix them, or to have them affixed.
Mrs. Bochester I She did not exist : she would not be bom
till to-morrow, some time after eight o'clock a.k , ; and I
would wait to be assured she had come into the world alive
before I assigned to her all that property. It was enough
that in yonder closet, opposite my dressing-table, garments
Baid to be hers had already displaced my black stufiT Lowood
{rook and straw bonnet : for not to me appertuned that anit
of wedding raiment, the pearl-coloured robe, the vapoury
veil, pendent from the usurped portmanteau. I shut the
closet, to oonceal the strange, wraith-like apparel it ooq-
tained; which, at thie evening hour — nine o'clock — gave
out certainly a most ghostly shimmer through the shadow
of my api^tment.'I will leave yon by yourseU, white

the monster splinters were living things, and could hear me.
'I think, scatiied as you look, and charred and scorched,
there must be a little sense of life in -you yet ; rising out of
that adhesion at the faithful, honest roots : you will never
have green leaves more — never more see birds making nests
and singing idyls in your boughs ; the time of pleasure and
love is over with you; but you are not desolate: each of
you has a conurade to sympathise with him in his decay.'
As I looked up at them, ilie moon appeared momentarily in

Uood-red and half overcast ; she seenied to throw on me one
bewildered, dreary glance, and buried herself again instantly
in the deep drift of cloud. The wind fell, for a second,
round Thomfield ; but far away over wood and water, poured
a wild, melancholy wail : it was sad to listen to, and I ran
off again.
Here and there I strayed through the orchard, gathered
up the apples with which the grass round the tree roots was
thickly strewn : then I employed myself in dividing the ripe
from the unripe ; I carried them into the house and put
them away in the store-room. Then I repaired to the
library to ascertain whether the fire was lit ; for, though
summer, I knew on such a gloomy evening Mr. Rochester
would like to see a cheerful hearth when he came in : yes,
the fire had been kindled some time, and burnt welL I
placed his arm-chair by the chimney-comer: I wheeled
the table near it : I let down the curtain, and had the candles
brought in ready for lighting. More restless than ever,
when I had completed these arrangements I could not sit
still, nor even remain in the house : a little timepiece in the
room and the old clock in the hall simultaneously struck
ten.

A hearty kissing I got for a welcome ; and some boastful
triumph ; which I swallowed as well as I could. He checked
himself in his exultation to demand,'But is there dnything
the matter, Janet, that you coma to meet me at such an
hour ? Is there anything wrong ? *
'No ; but I thought you would never come. I could
not bear to wait in the house for you, especially with this

_:he calmness of the air and sky forbade apprehensiooi
respecting yonr safety or comfort on your journey. I walked
& linle while on the pavement after tea, thinking of yoa;
And I beheld you in imagination so near me I scarcely
rsissed your actual presence. I thought of the life that lay

its own strait channeL I wondered why moralists call this
world a dreary wilderness : for me it blossomed like a rose.
Just at sunset the air turned cold and the sky cloudy : I
went in. Sophie called me upstairs to look at my wedding-
dress, which they had just brought ; and under it in the box
I found your present — the veil which, in your princely
extravagance, you sent for from London : resolved, I suppose,
sicce I would not have jewels, to cheat me into accepting
something as costly. I smiled as I unfolded it, and devised
how I would tease you about your aristocratic tastes, and
;. our efforts to masque your plebeian bride in the attributes
of a peeress. I thought how I would carry down to you the
square of unembroidered blond I had mj-self prepared as a
covering for my low-bom head, and ask if that was not good
enough for a woman who could bring her husband _neither
foriune, beauty, nor connections. I saw plainly how yon
would look ; and heard your impetuous republican answers,

that did not scare me, because I am used to the sight of the

'Not at first. But presently she took my veil from its

I rose. There were no groomsmen, no bridesmaids, no

woolottin have spoken to her, bat my hand was held by a
grasp of iron: I was harried along by a stride I ooaldhaidly
follow; and to look at Mr. Boohester's hoe was to feel that
not a seoond of delay woold be tolerated for any parpose.
I wonder what other bridegroom ever looked as he did-— so
bent op to a pnrpose, so grimly resolato : or who, under
sooh steadfast brows, ever revealed sooh flaming and flash-
ingeyes.
I know not whether the day was & ir orfoal ; in descend-
ing the drive, I gazed neither on sky nor earth ; my heart
was with my eyes; and both seemed migrated into Mr.
Boohester's frame. I wanted to see the invisible thing on
which, as we went along, he appeared to fasten a glance
fierce and felL I wanted to feel the thoughts whose force
he seemed breasting and resisting.
At the churchyard wicket he stopped : he discovered I
was quite out of bveath.
'Am I cruel in my love ?'he said.'Delay an instant:
lean on me, Jane.'
And now I can recall the picture of the grey old house of
Ood rising calm before me, of a rook wheeling round the
steeple, of a ruddy morning sky beyond. I remember
something, too, of the green grave-mounds ; and I hai^e not
forgotten, either, two figures of strangers, straying amongst
the low hillocks, and reading the mementoes graven on the
few mossy head-stones. I noticed them, bemuse, as they

towaids Mr. Booherter, m his lipi nnokwed to ask, ^VfilA
fhoa have this woman for thy wedded wife?* — when a dit-
tbeft and near voiee said : — ^^ The marriage eannot goon: I
dedlare the exiatenoe of an imnediment.*
The dergyman loolced up i^ the speaker, and stood mute ;
the deik did the same; Mr. Bodhester moved slightly, as if
an eartfignake had roUed nnder his feet : taking a firmer
footing, and not turning his head or eyes, he said, * Ftooeed.'
FtoCoond nlenoe UH when he had nttered that woid,
with deep but low intonation. Presently Mr. Wood said:—
*I oannol prooeed without scmie investigation into what hai
been asserted, and evidenoe of its truth or falsehood.'
'The oerenumy is quite broken of^'sobjoined the 70100
belundns.'I am in a oondition to prove my allegatkm:
an insaperaUe impediment to this marriage exists.*
Mr. Bobhester heard, bat heeded not : he stood stabbom
and rig^ : making no movement^ bat to possess himself of
my hand. What a hot and strong grasp he had i — and how
like qaarried marble was his pale, & m, massive front at tfait

Mr. Wood seemed at a loss. * What is the nature of the
impediment?'he asked.'Perhaps it may be got over^
explained away ?'
'Hardly,'was the answer : * I have called it insuperable,
and I speak advisedly.'
The speaker came forwards, and leaned on the rails.
He ooniinued, uttering each word distinctly, calmly, steadily,
but not loudly.
'It simply consists in the enstence of a previous
marriage. Mr. Rochester has a wife now living.'
My nerves vibrated to those low-spoken words as they
had never vibrated to thunder — my blood felt their subtle
violence as it had never felt frost or fire : but I was collected,
and in no danger of swooning. I looked at Mr. Bochester :
I made him look at me. Els whole face was colourless

the tapestried room, with its great bed and its pictorial
'You know this place, Mason/ said our guide ;'she bit
and stabbed you here.'
He lifted the hangings from the wall, uncovering the
second door: this, too, he opened. In a room without a
window there burnt a fire, guarded by a high and stroug
fender, and a lamp suspended from the ceiling by a chain.
Grace Poole bent over the fire, apparently cooking something
in a saucepan. In the deep shade, at the further end of the
room, a figure ran backwards and forwards. What it was,
whether beast or human being, one could not, at first sight,
tell : it grovelled, seemingly, on all fours ; it snatched and
growled like some strange wild animal : but it was covered
with clothing ; and a quantity of dark, grizzled hair, wild as
a mane, hid its head and face.

Sou time in-t!i6 afternoon I raised my head, aad looUng
loond and aedng " die weeiem mm gilding the sign of its

Bat the answer my mind gave—'Leave Thomfield at

said, I ooold not bear sneh words now.'That I am not
Edward Bochester^s bride is the least part of my woe,'I
alleged :'that I have wakened oat of most glorioas dreams,
and f oond them all void and vain, is a horror I ooold bear
and master ; bat that I most leave him decidedly, instantly,
entirely, is intolerable. I cannot do it'
Bat ti^en, a voice within n» averred that I coold do it;
and foretold that I should do it. I wrestled with my own
resolution: I wanted to be weak that I might avoid the
awful passage of further 8u£Fering I saw laid out for me ; and
conscience, turned tyrant, held passion by the throat, told
her tauntingly she had yet but dipped her dainty foot in the
slough, and swore that with that arm of iron he would thrust
her down to unsounded depths of agony.
'Let me be torn away, then I'I cried'Let another help
met'
'No ; you shall tear yourself away, none shall help you :
yon shall, yourself, pluck out your right eye : yourself cut
off your right hand : your heart shall be the victim ; and
you, the priest, to transfix it'
I rose up suddenly, terror-struck at the solitude which lo
ruthless a judge haunted, — at the silence which so awful a
voice filled. My head swam as I stood erect : I perceived
that I was sickening from excitement and inanition ; neither

meal nor drink had passed my lips that day, for I had taken
no breakfast. And, with a strange pang, I now reflected that^
long as I had been shut up here, no message had been sent
to ask how I was, or to invite me to come down : not eren
little AdMe had tapped at the door; not eren Ifrs. lUrCax
had sought me. * Friends always forget Uiose whon^i fortnna
forsakes/ I murmured, as I undrew the bolt and .p*88ed onl
I stumbled over an obstacle : my head ¥ras lAill dissy, my
sight was dim, and my limbs were feebly* I could not soon
recover myself. I fell, but not on to tike ground ; an oai-
stretcbed arm caught me ; I looked up— I was supported
by Mr. Rochester, who sat in a chair across my chamber
threshold.
'Toucome out at last^'he said. ^Well, I have been
waiting for you long, and listemng : jret not one movement
have I heard, nor one sob : five minutes more of that death-
like hush, and I should have forced the lock like a burglar.
So, you shun me? — ^you shut yourself up and grieve alone I
I would rather you had come and upbraided me vrith
vehemence. You are passionate : I expected a scene of some
kind. I was prepared for the hot rain of tears; only I
wanted them to be shed on my breast : now a senseless floor
has received them, or your drenched handkerchief. But I
err : you have not wept at all I I see a white cheek and a
faded eye, but no trace of tears. I suppose, then, your^eart
has been weeping blood ?
'Well, Jane ; not a word of reproach ? Nothing Utter —
nothing poignant? Nothing to cut a feeling or sting a
passion? You sit quietly where I have placed yon, and
regard me with a weary, passive look.
'Jane, I never meant to wound you thus. If the man
who had but one little ewe lamb that was dear to him as a
daughter, that ate of his bread and drank of his cup, and lay
in his bosom, had by some mistake slaughtered it at the
shambles, he would not have rued his bloody blunder more
than I now rue mine. Will you ever forgive me ? *

'Sir, I do not wish to act against you,'I said ; and my
unsteady voice warned me to curtail my sentence.
'Not in your sense of the word, but in mine, yon are
scheming to destroy me. You have as good as said that I

who is just about to burst an insuflferable bond and plunge
headlong into wild license. I saw that in another moment,
and with one impetus of frenzy more, I should be able to do
nothing with him. The present— the passing second of
time — was all I had in which to control and restrain him :
a movement of repulsion, flight, fear, would have sealed my
doom, — and his. But I was not afraid : not in the least I
felt an inward power; a sense of influence, which sup-
ported me. The crisis was perilous; but not without its
charm: such as the Indian, perhaps, feels when he slips
over the rapid in his canoe. I took hold of his clenched
hand; loosened the contorted fingers, and said to him,
soothingly, —'Sit down ; I'll talk to you as long as you like,
and hear all you have to say, whether reasonable or
unreasonable.'

He sat down: bat he did not get leave to speak
directly. I had been straggling with tears for some time; I
had taken great pains to repress them, becanse I knew he
would not like to see me weep. Now, however, I oonsidered
it well to let them flow as freely and as long as they liked.
If the flood annoyed him, so much the better. So I gave
way and cried heartily*
Soon I heard him earnestly entreating me to be oom*
posed. I said I could not while he was in such a pasrion.
'But I am not angry, Jane : I only love you too well ;
and you had steeled your little pale face with soeh a
resolute, frozen look, I oould not endure it Hush, now,
and \snpe your eyes.*
His softened voice announced that he was subdued ; so I,
in my turn, became calm. Now he made an effort to rest
his head on my shoulder ; but I would not permit it Then
he would draw me to him : na
'Jane I Jane 1'he said, in such an accent of bitter sad*
j ness it thrilled along every nerve I had, * yon don*t love me,
I then? It was only my station, and the rank of my wife,
I that you valued ? Now that you think me disqualified to
become your husband you recoil from my touch as if I v?ere
some toad or ape.'
These words cut me: yet what could I io or say? I
j ought probably to have done or said nothing : but I was so
tortured by a sense of remorse at thus hurting his feelings I
could not control the wish to drop balm where I had
wounded.
'I do love you,'I said,'more than ever : but I must not
show or indulge the feeling : and this is the last time I must
express it'
'The last time, Jane I What! do you think you can

his eye blazed ; still I dared to speak : —'Sir, your wife is
living : that is a fact acknowledged this morning by your-
self. If I lived with you as you desire, I should then be
your mistress : to say otherwise is sophistical — ^is false.'
'Jane, I am not a gentle-tempered man — you forget that :
I am not long-enduring ; I am not cool and dispassionate.

He bared his wrist and offered it to me : the blood was
forsaking his cheek and lips; they were growing livid; I
was distressed on all hands. To agitate him thus deeply, by
a resistance he so abhorred, was cruel : to yield was out of
the question. I did what human beings do instinctively
when ihey are driven to utter extremity — looked for aid to
one higher than man: the words'God help mel'burst

'Well, Jane, being so, it was his resolution to keep the

his estate and leaving me a fair portion : all, he resolved,
should go to my brother Rowland. Yet as little could he
endure that a son of his should be a poor man. I must be
pro\ided for by a wealthy marriage. He sought me a part-
ner betimes. Mr. Mason, a West India planter and merchant,
was his old acquaintance. He was certain his possessions
were real and vast: he made inquiries. Mr. Mason, he
found, had a son and daughter ; and he learned from him
that he could and would give tiie latter a fortune of thirty
thousand pounds : that sufficed. When I left college I was
sent out to Jamaica, to espouse a bride already courted for
me. My father said nothing about her money ; but he told
me Miss Mason was the boast of Spanish Town for her
beauty : and this was no lie. I found her a fine woman, in

of society» the pmrienoe, the rashness, the blindness of yoath,
win not hnrry a man to its oommission. Her relatiTes
enoonraged me ; oompetitors piqued me ; she aUured toe: a
marriage was aobioTed almost before I knew where I was.
Oh, I have no respeot for myself when I think of that acti
— an agony of inmrd oontempt masters me. I never loved,
I never esteemed, I did not even know her. I was not sue
of the ezistenoe of one virtoe in her nature : I had marked
neither modesty, nor benevolenoe, nor candour, nor refine-
ment in her mind or manners — and, I married her : — gross,
grovelling, mole-eyed blockhead that I was I With len sin
I might have— but let me remember to whom I am
speaking.
'My bride's mother I had never seen : I understood she
was dead. The honeymoon over, I learned my mistake;
she was only mad, and shut up in a lunatic asylum. There
was a younger brother, too, a complete dumb idiot. The
elder one, whom you have seen (and whom I cannot hate,
whilst I abhor all his kindred, because he has some grains of
affection in his feeble mind ; shown in the continued interest
he takes in his wretched sister, and also in a dog-like attach-
ment he once bore me), will probably be in the same state
one day. My father, and my brother Rowland, knew all
this ; but they thought only of the thirty thousand pounds,
and joined in the plot against me.
'These were vile discoveries ; but, except for the treachery
of ooncealment, I should have made them no subject of
reproach to my wife : even when I found her nature wholly
alien to mine ; her tastes obnoxious to me ; her cast of mind
common, low, narrow, and singularly incapable of being led
to anything higher, expanded to anything larger — ^when I

I repi-essed the deep antipathy I fell.

with that woman upstairs four years, and before thai time
she had tried me indeed : her character ripened and developed

In the eyes ci the world I was doubtless covered with grimy
dishonour: bat I resolved to be dean in my own sight— and
ta the last I repudiated the contamination of her crimes, and
wrenched myself from connection with her mental def eots.
Still, society associated my name and person with hers I I
yet saw her and heard her daily : something of her breath
(faugh I) mixed with the air I breathed; and, besides, I
remembered I had once been her husband — that recollection
was then, and is now, inexpressibly odious to me : moreover,
I knew that while she lived I could never be the husband of
, another and better wife ; and though five years my senior
(her family and her father had lied to me even in the par-
ticular of her age), she was likely to Uve as long as I, beiog
as robust in frame as she was infirm in mind. Thus, at the
age of twenty-six, I was hopeless.
* One night I had been awakened by her yells — (since the
medical men had pronounced her mad she had of course
been shut up) — it was a fiery West Indian night ; one of the
description that frequently precede the hurricanes of those
climates ; being unable to sleep in bed, I got up and opened
the window. The air was like sulphur-steams — I could find

'I said this whilst I knelt down at and unlocked a trunk

for not being insane, the crisis of exquisite and unalloyed
despair which had originated the. wish and design of

imlled to the tome, and fiUed with liying Uood— my being
longed for zenewat— my eonl thirsted for a pore draught. I
saw Hope revite— and felt Begeneration possible. From a
flowery arch at the bottom of my garden I|;a2ed over ihesea
— ^Uner than the sky: the old world was beyond; dear
pioepeets opened thus : —
* ** Qo/* said Hope^ ** and live again in Bnrope : there it
is not known vriiat a sullied name yon bear, nor what a filthy
bmden is bound to yon. Yon may take the maniac with
you to " Kngland ; oonfine her with due attendanoe and pre-
cautions at Thflomfield : then travel yourself to what dime
you will, and form what new tie you like. That woman, who
has so abused your long-su£GBring— so sullied your name;
so outrag e d your honour; so bHg^ted your youth -is not your
wife; nor aze you her husband. See that sheis cared for u
her condition demands, and you have done all that God and
Humanity require of you. Let her identity, her connection
with yourself, be buried in oblivion : you are bound to im*
part ttiem to no living bdng. Place her in safety and com-
fort : shelter her degradation with secrecy, and leave her. "
'I acted predsdy on this suggestion. My father and
brother had not made my marriage known to their acquain-
tance ; because, in the very first letter I wroto to apprise
them of the union — having already begun to experience
extreme disgust of its consequences ; and from the family
character and constitution seeing a hideous future opening
to me — I added an urgent charge to keep it secret; and
very soon the infamous conduct of the wife my father had
selected for me was such as to make him blush to own
her as his daughter-in-law. F^r from desiring to publish
the connection, he became as anxious to conceal it as

I You are not to suppose that I desired perfection, dther d
mind or person. I longed only for what suited me— for tba
antipodes of the Creole : and I longed vainly. Amongrt
them all I found not one whom, had I been ever so free, I —
I warned as I was of the risks, the horrors, the loathings d
■ incongruous unions — would have asked to marry me. I > i8-
I appointment made me reckless. I tried dissipation — neyer
i debauchery: that I hated, and hate. That was my Indian
1 Messalina's attribute : rooted disgust at it and her rec drained
] me much, even in pleasure. Any enjoyment that bordered
on riot seemed to approach me to her and her vices, and I
eschewed it.
'Tet I could not live alone ; so I tried the companionship
1 of mistresses. The first I chose was Gdline Yarens — another
! of those steps which make a man spurn himself when he re-
; calls them. You already know what she was, and how my
'liaison with her terminated. She had two successors : an
j Italian, Oiacinta, and a German, Clara; both considered
i singularly handsome. What was their beauty to me in a few

. in three months. Clara was honest and quiet ; but heavy,

'On a frosty winter afternoon I rode in nght of Thom-

pleasure there. On a stile in Hay Lane I saw a quiet little
figure sitting by itself. I passed it as negligentiy as I did
the pollard willow opposite to it ; I had no presentiment of
what it would be to me; no inward warning that the
arbitress of my life — my genius for good or evil — ^waited
there in humble guise. I did not know it even when, on

to pace the gallery. Now and then, in pasnng a easement
you glanced out at the thidk-falling snow ; yon listenad to

— ^I am bound to yon witti a strong attachment. I think
you good, gifted, lovely: a fervent, a solemn passion is
conceived in my heart ; it leans to you, draws you to my
centre and spring of life, wraps my existence about you— and,
kindling in pure, powerful flame, fuses you and me in one.
'It was because I felt and knew this that I resolved to
marry you. To tell me that I had already a wife is empty
mockery : you know now that I had but a hideous demon.
I was wrong to attempt to deceive you ; but I feared a
stubbornness that exists in your character. I feared early
instilled prejudice : I wanted to have you safe before hazard-

to your nobleness and magnanimity at first, as I do now-

my hunger and thirst aftcor a higher and worthier existence

faithfully and well loved in return. Then I should have asked
you to accept my pledge of fidelity, and to give me yours :

^almost exhausted.

on me as soon as I lay down in bed. I was transported in

mind impressed vath strange fears. The light that long ago
had struck me into syncope, recalled in this vision, seemed
glidingly to mount the wall, and tremblingly to pause in the
oentre ctf the obscured ceiling. I lifted up my head to look :

the roof resolved to cloudB, high and dim; tiia f^Lmm was
such as the moon imparts to yapours she is aboat to aever.
I watched her oome— watched with the strangeat antidpa-
tioD ; as though some word of doom were to bo written on
her disk. She broke forth as never moon yet borvt from
cloud: a hand first penetrated the saUe folds and waved
them away; then, not a moon, bat a white bmnan fonn
shone in the azure, inclining a ^orious brow earthward. It
gazed and gazed on me. It spolra to my spirit : immeasoraMy
distant was the tone, yet so near, it whispered in my heart —
* My daughter, flee temptation I'

So I answered after I had waked from the tranoe-like
dream. It was yet night, but July nights are short : soon
after midnight dawn oomes.'It cannot be too early to
commence ttie task I have to fulfil,'thought L I rose : I
was dressed ; for I had taken off nothing but my shoes. I
knew where to find in my drawers some linen, a locket^ a
ring. In seeking these articles I encountered the beads of a
pearl necklace Mr. Bochester had forced me to accept a few
days ago. I left that ; it wasnot mine : it was the visionary
bride's, who had melted in air. The other articles I made
up in a parcel ; my purse, containing twenty shillings (It vras
all I had), I put in my pocket : I tied on my straw bonnet^
pinned my shawl, took the parcel and my sUppers, whioh I
would not put on yet, and stole from my room.
'Farewell, kind Mrs. Fairfax I'I whispered, a^ I glided
past her door.'Farewell, my darling Ad & le I'I said, as I
gl & nced towards the nursery. No thought could be admitted
of entering to embrace her. I had to deceive a fine ear : tor
aught I knew, it might now be listening.
. I would have got past Mr. Bochester's chamber without
a pause ; but my heart momentarily stopping its beat at thai
threshold, my foot was forced to stop alsa No sleep veas
there : the inmate was walking restlessly from wall to wall ;
and again and again he sighed while I listened. There was
a heaven— a temporary heaven— in this room for me^ if I

I
chose : I had bat to go in and to sa; —'Mr. Boohester, I will
love you and live with yoa through lifa till death,'and a
fount of rapture would spring to my lips. I thought of
this.
That kind master, who coold not sleep now, was wcuting
with impatioucfl for day. He would send for me in the
morning ; I should be gone. He would have me sought for :
vainly. He would toel himself forsaken ; his love rejected :
he would suffer ; perhaps grow desperate. I thonght of this
too. My hand moved towards the lock ; I caught it back,
and glided on.
Drearily I wound my way downstairs : I knew what I
had to do, and I did it mechanically. I sought the key of

A mile ofi^ beyond the fields, lay a road which stretched
in the contrary direction to Milloote ; a road I had never
travelled, but often noticed, and wondered where it led:
thither I bent my atepi. No reflection was to he allowed
DOW : not one glanoe was to be cast back ; not even one

I that smile on his road, but of the Uook and axe-edge; of the

end : and I thought of drear flight and homeleBS wandering
—and, ohi with agony I thought of what I left I ooold
not hdp it I thought of him now— in his room— watching
the sunrise; hoping I should soon come to say I would
I stay with him, and be his. . I longed to be his; I panted to
I return : it was not too late ; I could yet spare him the bitter
! pang of bereavement As yet my flight, I was sure, was undis-
I covered. I oould go back and be his comforter — ^his pride ;
1 his redeemer from misery ; perhaps from ruin. Oh) thai
! fear of his self-abandonment — far worse than my abandon*
ment— how it goaded me I It VTas a barbed arrow-
head in my breast; it tore me when I tried to extract it; it
sickened me when remembrance thrust it further in. Birds
began singing in brake and copse: birds were faithful to
their mates; birds were emblems of love. What was I?
In the midst of my pain of hearty and frantic effort of
principle, I abhorred myself. I had no solace from self
approbation : none even from self-respect I had injured —
j wounded — ^left my master. I was hateful in my own eyes.
Still I could not turn, nor retrace one step. God must have
led me on. As to my own will or conscience, impasdoned
grief had trampled one and stifled the other. I was weeping
wildly as I walked along my solitary way : fast, fast I went,
like one delirious. A weakness, beginning inwardly, extend-
ing to the limbs, seized me, and I fell : I lay on the ground
j some minutes, pressing my face to the wet turf. I had some
I fear— or hope — that here I should die : but I was soon up ;
crawling forwards on my hands and knees, and then again
raised to my feet — as eager and as determined as ever to
reach the road.
When I got there I was forced to sit to rest me under
the hedge ; and while I sat, I heard wheels, and saw a coach
come on. I stood up and lifted my hand; it stopped. I

asked where il was going : the driver named a place a long
way o & ^ and where I was sure Mr. Bochester had no con-
nections. I asked for what sum he would take me there;
he said thirty shillings ; I answered I had but twenty ; well,
he would try to make it do. He further gave me l^ve to
get into the inside, as the vehicle was empty : I entered, was
^ut in, and it rolled on its way.
Gtonde reader, may you never feel what I then felt I
May your eyes never shed such stormy, scalding, heart-witmg
tears as poured from mine. May you never appeal to
Heaven in prayers so hopeless and so agonised as in that
hour left my lips : for never may you, like me, dread to be
the instrument of evil to what you wholly love.

1 Two days are passed. It is a summer evening; the coaeh-
i man has set me down at a place called Whitcross ; he could
1 take me no farther for the som I had pyen, and I was not
^ possessed of another shilling in the world. The coach is a
I mile off by this time; I am alone. At this moment I dis-
1 cover that I forgot to take my parcel out of the pocket of the
i
«
1
coach, where I had placed it for safety; there it remains*
there it must remain ; and now» I am absolutely destitute.
Whitcross is no town, nor even a hamlet ; it is but a stone
pillar set up where four roads meet : white-washedt I suppose*
I to be more obvious at a distance and in darkness. Four
. arms spring from its summit: the nearest town to which
I these point is, according to the inscription, distant ten miles ;
I the farthest, above twenty. From the weU-known names of
j these towns I learn in what county I have lighted ; a north-
. midland shire, dusk with moorland, ridged with mountain :
this I see. There are great moors behind and on each hand
of me ; there are waves of mountains far beyond that deep
valley at my feet. The population here must be thin, and I
see no passengers on these roads : they stretch out east, west,
north, and south — white, broad, lonely ; they are all cut in
j the moor, and the heather grows deep and wild to their very
I verge. Tet a chance traveller might pass by ; and I wish
I no eye to see me now : strangers would wonder what I am
doing, lingering here at the sign-post, evidently objectless
and lost. I might be questioned : I could give no answer
j but what would sound incredible and excite suspicion. Not
a tie holds me to human society at this^ moment — not a
charm or hope calls me where my fellow-creatures are — ^none

me. I have no relative but the universal mother. Nature : I
will seek her breast and ask repose.
I Btmck straight iato the heath ; I held on to a hollow
I saw deeply furrowing the brown moorside ; I waded knee-
deep in its dark growth ; I turned with its tumiugs, and
finding a moss- blackened granite crag in a hidden angle, I
sat down under it. High banks of moor were about me ; the
crag protected my head : the sky was over that.
Some time passed before I felt tranquil even here : I bad
a vague dread that wild cattle might be near, or that some
Sporlaman or poacher might discover me. If a gust of wind
swept the waste, I looked up, fearing it was the rush of a bull ;
if B, plover whistled, I imagined it a man. Finding my
»p|s«tMndoiu vaknaiai, bowarcr, and oalmed by tha daqt
dlanoa tint taigned m emiiDg daeBnaJ ■! nlgbtftjl, I took
oodA^mmw. AayetlluMtDot thought; Iludonlyliitned,

What wM I to do? Whara to go? Ob, IntoknUa

a long way mast yet be measured by my weary, trembling
limbs, before I oonld reach boman balntation — when oold
oharity most be entreated before I oonld get a lodging:
reluctant sympathy importoned: almost certain repulse
incnrred : before my tale coold be listened to, or one < rf mj
wants relieved!
I touched the heath : it was dry, and yet wans with the
beat of the summer-day. I looked at the sky ; it was pure :
a kindly star twinkled just above the chasm ridga. The dew
fell, hut with propitious softness ; no breexe whispered.
Nature seemed to me benign and good ; I thought she loved
me, outcast as I was ; and I, who from man oonld anticipate
only mistrust, rejeotion, insnl^ clung to her with iUitl
fondness. To-night, at leas^ I would be her gneat — as I
was her child : my mother would lodge me without motwy
and without price. I bad one morsel of bre»d yet: the

at noon with a stray penny— my last coin. Isaw ripe bil-
« berries gleaming here and there, like jet beads in the heath :
i I gathered a handful and ate them with the bread. My
^ hanger, sharp before, was, if not satisfied, appeased by this
hermit's meal I said my evening prayers at its oonblusicni,
and then chose my oouoh.
Beside the crag the heath was very deep: when I lay
I down my feet were buried in it ; rising high on each dde^ it
left only a narrow space for the night-air to invade. I folded
my shawl double, and spread it over me for a coyerlet ; a
low, mossy swell " was my pillow. Thus lodged, I was not^
at least at the commencement of the night, cold.
My rest might have been blissful enough, only a sad heart
broke it It plained of its gaping wounds, its inward bleed-
ing, its riven chords. It trembled for llr. Bochester and his
doom : it bemoaned him with bitter pity ; it demanded him
with ceaseless longing : and, impotent as a bird with both
wings broken, it still quivered its shattered pnions in vain
attempts to seek him.
Worn out with this torture of thought, I rose to my
knoes. Night was come, and her planets were risen : a safe,
j still night ; too serene for the companionship of fear. We
. know that God is everywhere; but certainly we feel ffis
presence most when His works are on the grandest scale
spread before us : and it is in the unclouded night-sky, where
His worlds wheel their silent course, that we read clearest
His infinitude, His omnipotence, His omnipresence. I had
risen to my knees to pray for Mr. Rochester. Looking up,
I, with tear-dimmed eyes, saw the mighty Milky Way. Be-
membering what it was — ^what countless systems there swept
. space like a soft trace of light — I felt the might and strength
■ of God. Sure was 1 of His efficiency to save what He had
^ made : convinced I grew that neither earth should perish
j nor one of (he souls it treasured. I turned my prayer to
^ thanksgivmg : the Source of Life was also the Saviour of
spirits. Mr. Bochester was safe : he was God's, and by Qod

valley at my right hand was fall of pastme-fields, and ooni-
J fields, and wood; and a gUttoring stream ran sg-sag
1 through the varied shades of green, the meUowing grain, the
1 sombre wood-land, the clear tmd snnny lea. B ecalled by the
1 rumbling of wheels to the road before me, I saw a heaTfly-
laden waggon labouring up the hill; and not hr beyond weco
two cows and their drover. Human life and hmnan labour
werenear. I must straggle on: strive to live and bend to ioQ
like the rest
About two o'clock p Ji. I entered the village. At the
bottom of its one street there was a little shop with some
cakes of bread in the window. I coveted a cake of bread.
With that refreshment I could perhaps regain a degree of
energy; without it, it would be difficult to proceed. The
1 wish to have some strength and some vigour returned to me
I as soon as I was amongst my fellow-beings. I felt it would
be degrading to faint with hunger on the causeway of a
hamlet. Had I nothing about me I could ofEor in exchange
i for one of these rolls? I considered. I had a small silk
; handkerchief tied round my throat; I had my gloves. I
i could hardly tell how men and women in extremitiee of
destitution proceeded. I did not know whether dther of
these articles would be accepted : probably they would not;
but I must try.
I entered the shop : a woman was there. Seeing a re >
spcctably-dressed person, a lady as she supposed, she came
forward with civility. How could she serve me? I was
seized with shame : my tongue would not utter the request
I had prepared. I dared not offer her the half -worn gloves,
I the creased handkerchief : besides, I felt it would be absurd.
I only begged permission to sit down a moment, as I was
tired. Disappointed in the expectation of a customer, she
I coolly acceded to my request She pointed toa seat ; I sank
. into it. I felt sorely urged to weep ; but conscious how un-
seasonable such a manifestation would be, I restrained it
Soon I asked her,'if there were any dressmaker or plain*
work-woman in the village ?'

She leemed to be tind of toy qaertions : and, indeed,
wh & t claim bed I to importune her? A neighbour or two
c & me in ; m; cbur was evidently wanted. I took leave.
I passed up the street, looking as I went at all thehonsei
to the right hand and to the left : but I could disoover no
^etext, nor see an induoement, to enter any. I rambled
round the bamlet, gcung sometimes to a little diBtanoe and
returning agun, for an hour or more. Huoh exhausted, and
suffering greatly now tta want of food, I turned aside into a
lane and sat down under the hedge. Ere many minutes had
elapsed I was sgwn on my feet, howerer, and again seareh-
ing for something — a resource, or at least an informant. A
pretty little house stood at the top of the laoe, with a garden
before it; exquisitely neat, and ImlUantly bloooung. I
stoj^ied at it. What business had I to appioaoh the wUte
door or touoh the glittering knocker ? In what way oould it
poenbly be the interest of the inhaUtante of thatdweDing to
serve me? Yet I drew near and knocked. A mild-looUnfr

deanly-atidred young woman opened ttie door. In sodli m
voice as might be expected from a hopeless heart and banting
frame— a voice wietchedly low and faltering— I asked if a
servant was wanted here ?
'No/ said she;'we do not keep a servank'
< Can you tell me where I could get employment of any
kind?'I continued.'I am a stranger, without acquaint-
ance, in this place. I want some work : no matter what.'
But it was not her business to think for me» or to seek a
place for me : besides, in her eyes» how doubtful must have
appeared my. character, position, tale. She shook her head;
I she'was sorry she could give me no information,'and the
white door closed, quite gently and civilly : but it shut ma
out. If she had held it open a little longer, I beHoTS I
should have begged a pece of bread; for I was now broughl
low.
I could not bear to return to the sordid village; whera^
be^des, no prospect of aid was visible. I should have longed
rather to deviate to a wood I saw not far ofi^ which appeared

past; bnt at this day I can Boaroely bear to review the times
to which I allude: the moml degradatim, blent with the
phy^col snffering, form too distressing a reotJleotion ever to
be trilUi^ly dwelt on. I blamed none of those who lepolaed
me. I felt it wlis what was to be expected, and what oonld
not be helped : an ordinary beggar is treqoently an objeot o{
susiudon ; a wetl-diessed beggar inevitably sa To be sore
what I b^ged was employment : but whose btuuieBe was it
to provide me with employment 7 Not, oertainly, that cA
persona who saw me then tor the first time, and who knew
nothing about my oharaoter. And as to the woman who
would not take my handkerchief in exohange t < x her bread,
why, she was right ; if the offer appeared to hor nnister, or
the exchange unprofitable. Let me condense now. I am
sick of the subject
A little before dark I passed a {aim-hoose, at the open
door of which the farmer was sitting, eating Us supper of
bread and cheese ; I stopped, and sud : —'Will you pve me
a piece of bread ? tor I am very hungry.'He oast on me a
glance of surprise ; but without answering he out a thick slice
from bis loaf, and gave it to ma. I imagine he did not think
] was a beggar, but only an eccentric sort of lady, who had
taken a fancy to his brown loaf. As soon as I was out ol
sight of his house, I sat down and ate it.
I could not hope to get a lod^^ng nndei a roof, and
sought it in the wood I have before alluded ta But mj
night was wretched, my rest broken : the ground waa damp^
the air cold : besides intruders passed near me more than
once, and I had again and again to change my quarters : do
seDse of safety or tranquiUity befriended me. Towards
morning it rained ; the whole at the following day was wet.
Do not ask me, reader, to ^ve a minute account of that day ;
as before, I sought work ; as before, I was repulsed ; as
before, I starved ; but once did food pass my lips. At the
door of a cottage I saw a little girl about to throw a mess ot
cold porridge into a pig trougK'Will you give me that ?'
lasked.


■i* I
402 JANB BYBB
She staled al ma.'Moiher I'she ezolaimed ; * tbare it
a woman wanto.me to give her these pcmidge.'
* Welly lass,'replied a voice within,'give it her if she's s
beggar. T* pig doesn't want it'
The gbi emptied the sti£hned mould into my hand, and I
devoured it ravenondy.
As the vTet twilight deepened, I stopped in a solitsiy
bridle-path, which I had been pursuing an hour or more.-
'My strength is quite iailing me,'I said, in soliloquy.
*I feel I cannot go much further. Shall I be an outcul
again this night? While the rain descends so, must I lay
my head on the cold, dxenched ground ? I f eur I cannot do
otherwise: for who will receive'me? But it will be veiy
dreadful : with this feeling of hunger, faintness,'chill, sad
this sense of desolation — this total prostration of hope. In
all likelihood, thou^ I should die before morning. And
why cannot I reconcile myself to the prospect of death?
Why do I struggle to retain a valueless lifo? Because I
know, or beHeve^ Mr. Bochester is still living : and ttien, to
die cf want and cold, is a bte to which nature camiot
submit passively. Oh, Providence! sustain me a litUe
longer I Aid — direct me !'
My glased eye vrandered over the dim and misty land-
scape. I saw I had strayed far from the village : it was
quite out of sight The very cultivation surrounding it had
disappeared. I had; by cross-ways and by-paths, once more
drawn near the tract of moorland; and now, only a few
fields, almost as wild and unproductive as the heath bom
which they were scarcely reclaimed, lay between me and the
dusky UlL
'Well, I would rather die yonderthan in a street, or oo
a frequented road,'I reflected.'And far better that crowi,
and ravens— if any ravens there be in these regions — ehooU
pick my flesh from my bones, than that they should be prisoned
in a workhouse coffin and moulder in a pauper's grave.'
To the hill, then, I turned. I reached it It remained
now only to find a hollow where I could He down, and led

at least hidden, if not seonxe: bat all the sorboe of the
Nvaste looked leveL It showed no variation bat of tint;
green, where rush and moss overgrew the marshes ; black,
I where the dry soil bore only heath. Dark as it was getting,
i I could still see these changes ; though but as mere altenm-
I lions of light and shade : for cdour had hded with ibs day-
light
My eye still roved over the sullen sweUt and along the
moor-edge, vanishing amidst the wildest scenery ; when at
one dim point, far in among the marshes and the ridges* a
light sprang up.'That is an igfiis fatmu,'was my first
thought ; and I expected it would soon vanish. It burnt on*
however, quite steadily; neither receding nor advancing.
'Is it, then, a bonfire just kindled?* I questicmed. I
watched to see whether it would spread : but no ; as it did
not diminish, so it did not enlarge.'It may be a candle in
a house,'I then conjectured :'but if so, I can never reach
it. It is much too far away : and were it within a yard of
me, what would it avail? I should but knock at the door
to have it shut in my face.*
And I sank down where I stood, and hid my face agiunsi
the ground. I lay still a while : the night-wind swept over
! the hill and over me, and died moaning in the distance ; the
I rain fell fast, wetting me afresh to the skin. Could- 1 but
I have stiffened to the still frost — the friendly numbness of
] death— it might have pelted on : I should not have felt it ;
but my yet living flesh shuddered to its chilling influence.
I rose ere long.
The light was yet there: shining dim, but constant^
through the rain. I tried to walk again: I dragged my
exhausted limbs slowly towards it It led me aslant over
the hill,^ through a wide bog; which would have been
impassable in winter, and was splashy and gh^Mpg even
now, in the height of summer. Here I fell twice ; but as
often I rose and rallied my faculties. This light was my
forlorn hope : I must gain it.
Having crossed the marsh, I saw a trace of white over

in every point — sat, one in a low xoc1dng*ohair, the oilier on
% lower stool; both wore deep mooming of crape and
bombazeen, which sombre garb singularly set off very fair
necks and faces : a large old pointer dog rested its niassiye
head on the knee of one g}rl— in the lap of the other was
cushioned a black cat.
A strange place was this humble Utohen for subh
occupants I Who were they ? They could not be the
daughters of the elderly person at the table ; for she looked
like a rustic, and they were all delicacy and cultivation. I
had nowhere seen such faces as theirs : and yet, as I gazed on
them, I seemed intimate with every lineament I cannol
call them handsome— they were too pale and grave for the
word : as they each bent over a book, they looked thoughtful
almost to severity. A stand between them supported a second
I candle and two great volumes, to which they frequently
I referred ; comparing them seemingly with the smaller books
! they held in their hands, like people consulting a dictionary
■ to aid them in the task of translation. This scene was as
I silent as if all the figures had been shadows, and the fire-lit
I apartment a picture: so hushed was it, I could hear the
cinders fall from the grate, the clock tick in its obscure
comer ; and I even fancied I could distinguish the click-clibk
of the woman's knitting-needles. When, therefore^ a voice
broke the strange stillness at last, it was audible enough to
me.
'listen, Diana,'said one of the absorbed students;
'Franz and old Daniel are together in the night-time, and
Franz is telling a dream from which he has awakened in
terror — listen I'And in a low voice she read something, of
which not one word was intelligible to me ; for it was in an
unknown tongue — neither French nor Latin. Whether it
were Oreek or German I could not telL
'That is strong,'she said, when she had finished:'I

to her sister, repeated, while she gazed at the fire, a line of
what had been read. At a later day, I knew the language

The woman rose: she opened a door» ihxoiigh wbioh I
dimly saw a passage : soon I heard her stir a fiie in an inner
room ; she presently came back.
'Ah, childer I'said she,'it hir tronUes me to go into
yond'room now : it looks so lonesome wi'the chair empty
and set back in a comer/
She wiped her eyes with her apron : the two girls, gran
before, looked sad now.
'But he is in a better place,'oontinned Hannah:'we
shouldn't wish him here again. And then, nobody need to
have a quieter death nor he had.*
* Tou say he never mentioned ns ?'inquired one of the
ladies.
* He hadn't time, bairn : he was gone in a minute — ^was
I your father. He had been a bit ailing Uke the day before,
but naught to signify ; and when Mr. St. John asked if he
would like either o'ye to be sent for, he fair laughed at him.
He began again with a bit of a heaviness in his head the
Dczt day — that is, a fortnight sin'— and he went to sleep and
niver wakened : he wor'a'most stark when your brother
went into t'chamber and fand him. Ah, childer I that's V

I thought them so similar I could not teU where the old
8er\'ant (for such I now concluded her to be) saw the
difference. Both were fair complexioned and slenderly
made; both possessed faces full of distinction and intelli*
gence. One, to be sure, had hair a shade darker than the
other, and there was a difference in their style of wearing it :
Mary's pale brown locks were parted and braided smooth ;
Diana's duskier tresses covered her neck with thick curls.
The clock struck ten.

'and so wiU Mr. St John when, he comes in.'

They withdrew. Very soon one of the ladies returned—
I oould not tell which. A kind of pleasant stupor was steal-
ing over me as I sat by the genial fire. In an undertone sIm

aid, I contrived to mount a staircase ; my dripping clothes
were removed; soon a warm, dry bed received me. I

Thb recollection of about three days and nights snooeeding
this is very dim in my mind. I can recall some sensations
felt in that interval; but few thoughts framed, and no
actions performed. I knew I was in a small room, and in a
narrow bed. To that bed I seemed to have grown ; I lay on
it motionless as a stone ; and to have torn me from it would
have been almost to kill me. I took no note of the lapse of
time — of the change from morning to noon, from noon to
evening. I observed when any one entered or left the
apartment ; I could even teU who they v^ere ; I could under-
stand what was said when the speaker stood near to dm ;
but I could not answer ; to open my lips or move my Hmbs
was equally impossible. Hannah, the servant, was my most
frequent visitor. Her coming disturbed me. I had a feeling
that she wished me away : that she did not understand me
or my circumstances : ^at she was prejudiced against me.
. Diana and Mary appeared in the chamber once or twioe a
day. They would whisper sentences of this sort at my
bedside: —
'It is very well we took her in.*
1'Yes ; she would certainly have been foxmd dead at the
door in the morning, had she been left out all night. I
wonder what she has gone through ? *
'Strange hardships, I imagine — ^poor, emadated, pallid
.wanderer I'
I'She is not an uneducated person, I should think, by her
manner of speaking; her accent was quite pure; and the
clothes she took ofi^ though splashed and wet, were little
i worn and fine.'

Mr. St John ouooe but onoe : he looked at me, and said

and protraeted fatigue. He pronoonoed it needless to send
for a doctor: nature, he was sure, would manage best left

Tliere was no disease. He imagined my reoovery would be
rapid enough when onoe oomnmced. These opinions he
delivered in a few words, in a quiet, low voice ; and added,
after a pause^ in the tone of a man little accustomed to
expansive comment,'rather an unusual physiognomy;
certainly not indicative of vulgarity or degradation.*
'Bar otherwise,'responded Diana.'To speak truth, 8i
John, my heart rather warms to the poor little souL I wish

me some minutes ; then added,'She looks sensible, but not
at all handsome.*
'She is so iU, St. John.*
'HI or well, she would always be plain. The grace and
harmony of beauty are quite wanting in those features.*
On the third day I was better ; on the fourth, I codd
speak, move, rise in bed, and turn. Hannah had brought
me some gruel and dry toast, about, as I supposed, the
dinner hour. I bad eaten vnth relish : the food was good^

void of the feverish flavour which had hitherlo poisoned
what I had swallowed. When she left me, I felt compara-
tively strong and revived ; ere long satiety of repoee and
desire for action stirred me. I wished to rise; bat whai
could I put on ? Only my damp and bemired apparel, in
which I had slept on the ground and Ulen in the marsh. I
felt ashamed to appear before my benefactors so dad. I
was spared the humiliation.
On a chair by the bedside were all my own things, dean
and dry. My black silk frock hung against the wdL The
traces of the bog were removed from it ; the creases left by
the wet smoothed out : it was quite decent My very shoes
and stockings were purified and rendered presentable. There
were the means of washing in the room, and a comb and brush
to smooth my hair. After a weary process, and resting every
five minutes, I succeeded in dressing myself. My dothes hung
loose on me, for I was much wasted ; but I covered defiden*
des with a shawl, and once more, clean and respectable-
looking— no speck of the dirt, no trace of the disc^der I so
hated, and which seemed so to degrade me, left— I crept
down a stone staircase with the aid of the banisters to a
narrow low passage, and found my way presently to the
kitchen. _
It was full of the fragrance of new bread and the warmth
of a generous fire. Hannah was baking. Prejudices, it is
well known, are most difficult to eradicate from the heart
whose soil has never been loosened or fertilised by education :
they grow there, firm as weeds among stones. TTf^nnAK had
been cold and stiff, indeed, at the first : latterly she had
begun to rdent a little ; and when she saw me come in
and well-dressed, she even smiled.

'But I do think hardly of you,'I said ; * and I'll tell you
why — ^not so much because you refused to give me shelter,
or regarded me as an impostor, as because you just now
made it a species of reproach that I had. no *'brass, " and no
house. Some of the best people that ever lived have beenas
destitute as I am ; and if you are a Christian, you ought nol
to consider poverty a crime.'
* No more I ought,'said she :'Mr. St. John tells me so
too ; and I see I wor wrang — but I've dear a different notion
on you now to what I had.'You look a raight down dacent
little crater.'
'That will do — ^I forgive you now. Shake hands.'
She put her floury and homy hand into mine ; another
and heartier smile illumined her rough face : and from that
moment we were friends.
Hannah was evidently fond of talking. While I picked
the fruit and she made the paste for the pies, she proceeded
to give me sundry details about her deceased master and
mistress, and'the childer/ as she called the youDg people.
Old Mr. Bivers, she said, was a plain man enough ; hut
a gentleman, and of as ancient a family as could be found.
Marsh End had belonged to the Bivers'ever since it was %
house : and it was, she affirmed,'aboon two hundred year
old — for all it looked but a small, humble place, naught to
compare wi'Mr. Oliver's grand hall down i'Morton Vale.
But she could remember Bill Oliver's father a journeyman
needle-maker ; and th'Bivers'wor gentry i'thi'owd days
o'th'Henrys, as onybody might see by looking in'o th'
registers i'Morton Church vestry.'Still, she allowed,'the
owd maister was like other folk — naught mich out o't'common
way: stark mad o'shooting, and farming, and sich like.'
The mistress was different She was a great reader, and
studied a deal ; and the'bairns'had taken after her. There
was nothing like them in these parts, nor ever had been ;
they had liked learning, all three, almost from the time they

could speak; and they had always been *oC a mak* of tlieir
own.'Mr. St John, when he grew iip» would go to ocdlege
and be a parson ; and the girli^ as soon as they left sbbool,
would seek places as governesses: for they had told her their
father had some years ago lost agreatdeslof money byaman
he bad trusted turning bankrupt ; and as he was now not rich
enough to give them fortunes, they must provide for them-
selves. They had lived very little at home for a long whiles
and were only come now to stay a few weeks on aooonnt of
thdr father's death : but they did so like liarsh Bnd and
Morton, and all these moors and hills about They had
been in London, and many other grand towns; bat they
always said there was no place like home ; and then tfaey
were so agreeable with CAch other — ^never fell out nor
'threaped.'She did not know where there was sodi a
family for being united.
Having finished my task of gooseberry piddng, I asked
where the two ladies and their brother were now.
'Gone over to Morton for a walk; but they would be
back in half an hour to tea.*
They returned within the time Hannah had allotted them :
they entered by the kitchen door. Mr. St John, when ha
saw me, merely bowed and passed through ; the two ladies
stopped : Mary, in a few words, kindly and calmly expressed
the pleasure she felt in seeing me well enough to be aUe to
come down; Diana took my hand : she shook her head at me.
I'You should have waited for my leave to descend,'she
said.'You still look very pale — and so thinl Poor child 1 —
poor girl I'
Diana had a voice toned, to my ear, like the cooing of a
I dove. She possessed eyes whose gase I delighted to
I encounter. Her whole face seemed to me full of charm.
j Mary's countenance was equally intelligent— her features
equally pretty : but her expression was more reserved ; and
* her manners, though gentle, more distant. Diana looked
^ and spoke with a certsin authority : she had a will, evidently.
It was my nature to feel pleasure in yielding to an authority

She dosed the door, leaying me aolna with Mr. St. John,
wlio sat oppodte, a book or newspaper in his hand. I
examined, first, the parloor, and then its oooiipant.
The parlour was rather a small room, very plainly bu-
nished ; yet oomfortable, beoause dean and neat The old-
fashioned ohairs were very bright, and the walnut-wood taUe
was like a looking-glass. A few strange antique portraits of
the men and women of other days deoorated the stained waUs ;
a cupboard with glass doors contained some books and so
andent set of china. There was no superfluous ornament
in the room — not one modem piece of furniture, save a brsee
of work-boxes and a lady's desk in rosewood, which stood on
a side-table : everything — ^induding the carpet and curtains
— ^looked at once well worn and well saved.

were large and blue, with brown lashes; his high forehead*
colourless as ivory, was partially streaked over by nsrolnss
locks of fair hair.
This is a gentle delineationy is it not, reader ? Yet he
whom it describes scarcely impressed one with the idea of a
gentle, a yielding, an impressible, or even of a pladd nature.
Quiescent as he now sat, there was somthing about his
nostril, his mouth, his brow, which, to my perceptions*
indicated elements within either restless, or hard, or eager.
He did not speak to me one word, nor even direct to me one
glance, till his sisters returned. Diana, as she passed in and
out in the course of preparing tea, brought me a little oakeb
baked on the top of the oven.
'Eat that now,'shesiud :'you must be hungry. TTa.i^yi«^i^

I did not refuse it, for my appetite was awakened and
keen. Mr. Rivers now closed his book, approached Uie taUe,
j and, as he took a seat, fixed his blue pictorial-looking eyes
foil on me. There was an unceremonious directness, e
searching, decided steadfastness in his gaze notr, which toU
that intention, and not diffidence, had hitherto kept it averted
from the stranger.
'You are very hungry,'he said.
• I am, sir.'It is my way — it always was my way, by
instinct— ever to meet the brief with brevity, the direct with
plainness.
'It is well for you that a low fever has f oreed you to

* I trost I shall not eat long at your expense, sir/ was my
very domsily-oontrived, unpolished answer.

residence of your friends, we can write to them, and you may
be restored to home/
* That, I must plainly tell you, is out of my power to do ;
being absolutely without home and friends/
The three looked at me, but not distrustfully ; I felt there
was no suspicion in their glances : there was more of curiosity.
I speak particularly of the young ladies. St. John's eyes,
though clear enough in a literal sense, in a figurative one were
diffictdt to fathom. He seemed to use them rather as instm-
ments to search other people's thoughts, than as agents to
reveal his own: the which combination of keenness and
reserve was considerably more calculated to embarrass than
to encourage.
'Do you mean to say,'he asked,'that you are completely
isolated from every connection 7'
'I do. Not a tie links me to any living thing : not a daim
do I possess to admittance imder any roof in England.'
'A most singular position at your age I'
Here I saw his glance directed to my hands, which were
folded on the table before me. I wondered what he sought
there : his words soon explained the quest.
'You have never been married ? You are a spinster?'
Diana laughed.
'Why, she can't be above seventeen or eighteen yean
old, St. John,'said she.
'I am near nineteen : but I am not married. No.'
I felt a burning glow mount to my face ; for bitter and
agitating recollections were awakened by the aUusion to
marriage. They all saw the embarrassment and the emo-
tion. Diana and Mary relieved me by turning their eyes
elsewhere than to my crimsoned visage ; but the colder and
sterner brother continued to gaze, till the trouble he had
excited forced out tears as well as colour.
'Where did you last reside ?'he now asked.

*Tou are too inqnisitivev St John,* mnrmined Mary, in
ft low voice ; but he leaned over the table and xaqnived an
answer by a seoond firm and pieroing look.
'The name of the place where, and of the perBon with
whom I lived, is my secret/ I replied, oonoiaely.
'Which, if yon Uke, yon have, in my opinion, a rifjtA to
keep both from St. John and every other qnestioner/ remarked
Diana.
'Tet if I know nothing about you or your history, I can-
not help you,'he said.'And you need help : do you not?'
'I need it, and I seek it; so far, sir, that some ima
philanthropist vrill put me in the way of getting work whidh
I can do, and the remuneration for which will keep me : if
but in the barest necessaries of life.*.
'I know not whether I am a true philanthropist ; yet I
am willing to aid you to the utmost of my power, in a por-
pose 80 honest. First, then, tell me what you have been
accustomed to do, and what you can do.*
I had now swallowed my tea. I was mightQy refreshed
by the beverage ; as much so as a giant vrith vrine : it gave
new tone to my unstrung nerves, and enabled me to addresa
this penetrating young judge steadily.
'Mr. Bivers,'I said, turning to him, and looking at him^
as he looked at me, openly and without diffidence,'* you and
your sisters have done me a great service— the greatest m^n
can do his fellow-being ; you have rescued me, by your noble
hospitality, from death. This benefit conferred gives you an
unlimited claim on my gratitude ; and a claim, to a certain
extent, on my confidence. I will tell you as much of the
history of the wanderer you have harboured as I can tell
without compromising my own peace of mind — my ovm
security, moral and physical, and that of others.

'I have heard of Mr. Brocklehurst, and I have seen the

'I left Lowood nearly a year rince to become a private
governess. I obtained a good situation, and was happy.
This place I was obliged to leave four days before I came
here. The reason of my departure I cannot and ought not
to explain : it would be useless — dangerous ; and would sound
incredible. No blame attached to me ; I am as free from
culpability as any one of you three. Miserable I am, and must
be for a time ; for the catastrophe which drove me from a
house I had found a paradise was of a strange and direful
nature. I observed but two points in planning my departure
— speed, secrecy : to secure these I had to leave behind me
everything I possessed except a small parcel ; which, in my
hurry and trouble of mind, I forgot to take out of the coach
that brought me to Whitcross. To this neighbourhood,
then, I came, quite destitute. I slept two nights in the open
air, and wandered about two days without crossing a
threshold : but twice in that space of time did I taste food ;
and it was when brought by hunger, exhaustion and despair
almost to the last gasp that you, Mr. Bivers, forbade me to
perish of want at your door, and took me under the shelter
of your roof. I know all your sisters have done for me since
—for I have not been insensible during my seeming torpor—
and I owe to their spontaneous, genuine, genial compassion,
as large a debt as to your evangelical charity.'
'Don't make her talk any more now, St. John,'said
Diana, as I paused;'she is evidently not yet fit for
excitement. Come to the sofa, and sit down now, Miss
EUiott.'
I gave an involuntary half -start at hearing the alias ; I
had forgotten my new name. Mr. Bivers, whom nothing
seemed to escape, noticed it at once.
'You said your name was Jane Elliott ?'he observed.
'I did say so ; and it is the name by which I think it

'I do: I have already said sa Show me how to wovk,

'Indeed, you ihdll stay here,'said Diana, putting her
white hand on my head. _
'Tou ihdll,* repeated Ifary, in the tone ci undemonstrativo
sincerity which seemed natural to her.
'My sisters, you see, have a pleasure in keepng yon,*
said Mr. St. John, * as they would have a pleasure in keeping
and cherishing a half-frosen bird some wintry wind might
have driven through thdr casement. I feel more inclination
to put you in the way of keeping yourself: and shall
endeavour to do so : but observe, my sphere is narrow. I am
but the incumbent of a poor country parish : my aid must be
of the humblest sort And if you are inclined to despise the
day of small things, seek some more efficient succour than
suoh as I can ofifiBT.'
'She has already said that she is willing to do anything
honest she can do,'answered Diana for ine ;'and you know.

occupied before tea. I soon withdrew ; for I had talked as
much, and sat up as long, as my present strength would

Ths more I knew of the inmates of Moor Honse* the boiler
I liked them. In a few days I had so far reooTered my
health that I could sit up all day, and walk out sometimea.
I could join with Diana and Ifary in all thdr oooapations;
converse with them as much as they wished, and aid them
when and where they would allow me. There was a reTiy-
ing pleasure in this intercourse, of a kind now tasted by ma
for the first time — ^the pleasure arising from perfed conge-
niality of tastes, sentiments, and principles.
I liked to read what they liked to read : what they
enjoyed, delighted me ; what they approved, I reverenoed.
They loved their sequestered home. I, too, in the grey»
small, antique structure, with its low roof, its latticed case
ments, its mouldering walls, its avenue of aged firs — all
grown aslant under the stress of mountain winds; its
garden, dark with yew and holly — and where no flowers but
of the hardiest species would bloom — found a charm both
potent and permanent. They clung to the purple moors
behind and around their dweUing — to the hollow vale into
which the pebbly bridle-path leading from their gate
descended ; and which wound between fern-banks first, and
then amongst a few of the wildest little pasture-fields that
ever bordered a wilderness of heath, or gave sustenance to %
flock of grey moorland sheep, with their little mossy-faced
lambs: — they dung to this Scene, I say, with a perfect
enthusiasm of attachment. I could comprehend the feelings
and share both its strength and truth. I saw the fascination
of the locality. I felt the consecration of its loneliness : my
eye feasted on the outline of swell and sweep— on the wild

colouring oommnnioated to ridge and dell by moss, by
heaih-bell, by flower-sprinkled turf, by brilliant bracken, and
mellow granite crag. These details were just to me what
they were to them — so many pure and sweet sources of
pleasure. The strong blast and the soft breeze; the rough
and the halcyon day ; the hours of sunrise and sunset ; Ae
moonlight and the clouded night, developed for me, in these
regions, the same attraction as for them — ^wound round my
faculties the same spell that entranced thors.
Indoors we agreed equally well. They were both more
accomplished and better read than I was : but with eagerness
I followed in the path of knowledge they had trodden before
me. I devoured the books they lent me : then it was full
satisfaction to discuss with them in the evening what I had
perused during the day. Thought fitted thought; opinion
met opinion : we coincided, in short, perfectly.
If in our trio there v^as a superior and a leader, it wu
Diana. Physically, she far excelled me : she was handsome;
she was vigorous. In her animal spirits there was an
afiQuence of life and certainty of flow, such as excited my
wonder, while it bafiQed my comprehension. I could talk a
while when the evening commenced : but the first gush of
vivacity and fluency gone, I was fain to sit on a stool at
Diana's feet, to rest my head on her knee, and listen alter-
nately to her and Mary ; while they sounded thoroughly the
topic on which I had but touched. Diana ofiiared to teach
me German. I liked to learn of her : I saw the part of
instructress pleased and suited her ; that of scholar pleased
and suited me no less. Our natures dovetailed : mutual
affection — of the strongest kind — was the result. They dia-
covered I could draw : their pencils and colour-boxes were
immediately at my service. My skill, greater in this one
point than theirs, surprised and charmed them. Mary wouU
sit and watch me by the hour together : then she would take
lessons ; and a docile, intelligent, assiduous pupil she made.
Thus occupied, and mutually entertained, days passed like
hours and weeks like days.

As to Mr. St. John, the intimaoy whidi had arisen so
naturally and rapidly between me and his sisters did nd
extend to him. One reason of the distance yei obs er v ed
between us was that he was comparatively seldom at home :
a large proportion of his time appeared devoted to visiting
the sick and poor among the scattered populatloii of his
parish.
No weather seemed to hinder him in these pastoial
excursions: rain or fair, he would, when his hours of
morning study were over, take his hat, and, followed by his
father's old pointer Carlo, go out on his misdon oi love or
duty— I scarcely know in which light he regarded it. Some-
times, when the day wi^ very unfavourable, his sbters
would expostulate. He would then say, with a peculiar
smile, more solemn than cheerful, — * And if I let a gust of
wind or a sprinkling of rain turn me adde from these easy
tasks, what preparation would such sloth be for the fatnre I
propose to mysdtf ?'
Diana and Mary's general answer to this question was a*
sigh, and some minutes of apparently mournful meditation.
But besides his frequent absences, there was another
barrier to friendship with him: he seemed of a reserved,
an abstracted, and even of a brooding nature. Zealous uH his
ministerial labours, blameless in his life and habits, he yet
did not appear to enjoy that mental serenity, that inwaid
content, which should be the reward of every sincere Christian
and practical philanthropist. Often, of an evening, when he
- sat at the window, his desk and papers before him, he
would cease reading or writing, rest his chin on his handy
and deliver himself up to I know not what course of thought ;
but that it was perturbed and exciting might be seen in the
frequent flash and changeful dilation of his eye.
I think, moreover, that Nature was not to him that
treasury of delight it was to his sisters. He expressed once,
and but once in my hearing, a strong sense of the rugged
charm of the hills, and an inborn affection for the dark roof
and hoary walls he called his home ; but there was more of

gloom than pldasore in the tone and words in which the
sentiment was manifested ; and never did he seem to roam
the moors for the sake of their soothing silenoe— never seek
out or dwell upon the thousand peaceful delights they could
yield.
Incommunicative as he was, some time elapsed before I
had an opportunity of gauging his mind. I first got an idea
of its calibre when I heard him preach in his own church at
Morton. I wishi could describe that sermon ; but it is past
my power. I cannot even render faithfully the effect it pro-
duced on me.
It began calm — and indeed, as far as delivery and pitch
of voice went, it was calm to the end : an earnestly felt^ yet
strictly restrained zeal breathed soon in the distinct accents,
and prompted the nervous language. This grew to force-
compressed, condensed, controlled. The. heart was thrilled,
the mind astonished, by the power of the preacher : neither
was softened. Throughout there was a strange bittemess;
an absence of consolatory gentleness ; stem allusions to Gal*
vinistic doctrines-selection, predestination, reprobation—
were frequent ; and each reference to these points sounded
like a sentence pronounced for doom. When he had done,
instead of feeling better, calmer, more enlightened by his
discourse, I experienced an inexpressible sadness; for it
seemed to me — I know not whether equally so to others—
that the eloquence to which I had been listening had sprung
from a depth where lay turbid dregs of disappointment—
where moved troubling impulses of insatiate yearnings and
disquieting aspirations. I was sure St John Bivers — pore-
lived, conscientious, zealous as he was — ^had not yet found
that peace of God which passeth all understanding ; he had
no more found it, I thought, than had I ; with my conceialed
and racking regrets for my broken idol and lost elysium—
regrets to which I have latterly avoided referring; but which
possessed me and tyrannised over me ruthlessly.
Meantime a month was gone. Diana and Mary were
soon to leave Moor House, and return to the far different life

and scene which awaited them, as govemeeaes in a UEge^
fashionable, souih-of -England dty; where eaoh held a
situation in familieSi by whose wealthy and hanghtymembecs
they were regarded only as humble dependents^ and who
neither knew nor sought one of their innate ezoellenoes, and
appreciated only their acquired accomplishmenta as they
appreciated the skill of theur cook or the taste of their
waiting-woman. Mr. St. John had said nothing to me yet
about the employment he had promised to obtain for me;
yet it became urgent that I should have a vocation of some
kind. One morning, being left alone with him a few minutes
in the parlour, I ventured to approach the window-reoess —
. which his table, chair, and desk consecrated as a kind q{
I study— and I was going to speak; though not very well
knowing in what words to frame my inquiry— for it is at all
times difficult to break the ice of reserve glassing over suoh
natures as his — when he saved me the trouble by being the
first to conmience a dialogue*
LooUng up as I drew near —'You have a question to ask
of me ?'he stdd.
'Tes ; I wish to know whether you have heard of any
service I can offer myself to undertake.'
'I found or devised something for you three weeks ago ;
but as you seemed both useful and happy here-^ my sisters
had evidently become attached to you« and your society gave
them unusual pleasure — I deemed it inexpedient to break in
on your mutual comfort till their approacUng departure from
Marsh End should render yours necessary/
'And they will go in three days now?'I said.
'Yes ; and when they go I shall return to the parsonage
at Morton : Hannah will accompany me ; and this old house

I waited a few moments, expecting he would go on with
the subject first broached ; but he seemed to have entered
another train of reflection ; his look denoted abstraction from
me and my business. I was obliged to recall hlrp to a thfflrie

'What is the employment you had in view, Mr. Bivers?
I hope this delay will not have increased the difficulty of
securing it*
''Oh, no ; since it is an employment which depends only
on me to give, and you to accept'
He again paused : there seemed a reluctance to continue.
I grew impatient : a restless movement or two, and an eager
and exacting glance fastened on his face, conveyed Uie
feeling to him as efTectuaUy as words could have dokie, and
with less trouble.
'You need be in no hurry to hear/ he said;'let me
frankly tell you, I have nothing eligible or profitable to
suggest Before I explain, recall, if you please, my notioe,
dearly given, that if I helped you, it must be as the blind
man would help the lame. I am poor ; for I find that, when
I have paid my father's debts, all the patrimony remaining
to me will be this crumbling grange, the row of scathed fin
behind, and the patch of moorish soil, with the yew-trees
and holly-bushes in front I am obscure : Bivers is an old
name ; but of the three sole descendants of the race, two earn
the dependent's crust among strangers, and the third con-
siders himself an alien from bis native country — not only for
life, but in death. Yes, and deems, and is bound to deem,
himself honoured by the lot, and aspires but after the day
when the cross of separation from fleshly ties shall be laid
on his shoulders, and when the Head of that church-militant,
of whose humblest members he is one, shall give the word,
" Rise, foUow Me I'"
St. John said these words as he pronounced his sermons,
with a quiet, deep voice ; with an unflushed cheek, and a
coruscating radiance of glance. He resumed : — * And since
I am myself poor and obscure, I can offer you but a service
of poverty and obscurity. Tou may even think it degrading
— for I see now your habits have been what the world calls
refined : your tastes lean to the ideal ; and your society has
at least been amongst the educated — but I consider that no
service degrades which can better our race. I hold thst

the more arid and onreolaimed the soil where the Christian
bboorer's task of tillage is appcmited him— the ncantier the
meed his toil brings — the higher the honour. Sib, under
sach circumstanoesy is the destiny of the pioneer ; and the
first pioneers of the Oospel were the Apostles — Hbfii captain

< Well?'I said, as he again paused—* proceed.*
He looked at me before he proceeded : indeed, he aeemed
leisurely to read my face, as if its features and lines were
characters on a page. The conclusions drawn from this
scrutiny he partially expressed in his succeeding observa-
tions.
I believe you will accept the post I oBsr you,* said he ;
j'and hold it for a while: not permanently, though: any
more than I could permanently keep the narrow and nanow-
mg— the tranquil, hidden office of English country incum-
bent : for in your nature is an aUoy as detrimental to repose
as that in mine ; though of a different kind.'
'Do explain,'I urged, when he halted once more.
'I will ; and you shall hear how poor the proposal is, —
bow trivial — how cramping. I shall not stay long at Morton,
now that my father is dead, and that I am my own master.
I shall leave the place probably in the course o£ a twelve-
month: but while I do stay I will exert myself to the
utmost for its improvement. Morton, when I came.to it two
years ago, had no school: the children of the poor were
excluded from every hope of progress. I established one for
boys : I mean now to open a second school for girls. I have
hired a building for the purpose, with a cottage of two rooms
attached to it for the mistress's house. Her salary will be
thirty pounds a year ; her house is already fumicdbed, very
simply, but sufficiently, by the kindness of a lady, Ifiss
Oliver ; the only daughter of the sole rich man in my parish
—Mr. Oliver, the proprietor of a needle-factory and iron-
foundry in the valley. The same lady pays for the education
and clothing of an orphan from the workhouse ; on condition
I that she shall aid the mistress in such menial offices connected

with her own house and the sohool as her ocoapaiion of
teaching will prevent her having time to discharge in person.
Will you be this mistress?'
He put the question rather hurriedly ; he seemed half to
expect an indignant, or at least a disdainful, rejection of the
offer: not knowing all my thoughts and feelings, though
guessing some, he could not tell in what light the lot would
appear to me. In truth it was humble — but then it wu
sheltered, and I wanted a safe asylum : it was plodding—but
then, compared with that of a governess in a rich house, H
was independent ; and the fear of servitude with strangen
entered my soul like iron : it was not ignoUe — not unworthy
— not mentally degrading. I made my dedsion.
'I thank you for the proposal, Mr. Bivers ; and I accept
it with all my heart'
'But you comprehend me?'he said.'It is a village
school; your scholars will be only poor ffxls — cottagen'
children — at the best, farmers'daughters. Knitting, sewing,
reading, writing, cyphering, will be all you will have to
teach. What will you do with your accomplishments?
What with the largest portion of your mind — sentiments—
tastes?'
'Save them till they are wanted. They will keep.'
'You know what you undertake, then ?'
• I do.'
He now smiled : and not a bitter or asad smile, but one
well pleased and deeply gratified.
'And when will you commence the exercise of your
function ?'
'I will go to my house to-morrow ; and open the school,
if you like, next week.'
• Very well : so be it.'
He rose and walked through the room. Standing BtiD,
he again looked at me. He shook his head.
'What do you disapprove of, Mr. Bivers ?'I asked.
'Tou will not stay at Morton long : no, no I'

puzzled me.
j Diana and Mary Bivers became more sad and silent as
the day approached for leaving their brother and their home.
They both tried to appear as usual ; but the sorrow they had to
struggle against was one that could not be entirely conquered
or concealed. Diana intimated that this would be a different
partbg from any they had ever yet known. It would
probably, as far as St. John was concerned, be a parting tor
years : it might be a parting for life.

St John looks quiet, Jane ; but he hides a fever in his vitals.
You would think him gentle, yet in some things he is inex-
orable as death ; and the worst of it is, my conscience will
hardly permit me to dUssuade him from his severe decision:
certainly, I cannot for a mpment blame him for it. It ii
right, noble. Christian : yet it breaks my heart/ And the
tears gushed to her fine eyes. Mary bent her head low over
her work.
* We are now without father : we shall soon be without

At that moment a little accident supervened which
seemed decreed by fate purposely to prove the truth of the
adage that * misfortunes never come singly : * and to add to
their distresses the vexing one of the slip between the cup and
the lip« St. John passed the window reading a letter. He
entered.
'Otur uncle John is dead,* said he.
Both the sisters seemed struck : not shocked or appalled;
the tidings appeared in their eyes rather momentous than
a£3icting.
'D^ 7'repeated Diana.

She riveted a searching gaze on her brother's face. * And

'What then, Die?'he replied, maintaining a marble
immobility of feature.'What then? Why— nothing.

He threw the letter into her lap. She glanced over it, and
handed it to Mary. Mary perused it in silence, and returned
it to her brother. All three looked at each other, and all
three smiled — a dreary, pensive smile enough.
* Amen I We can yet live,'said Diana at last
'At any rate, it makes us no worse off than we wen
before,'remarked Mary.

He folded the letter, looked it in his desk, and again went

For some minutes no one spoke. Diana then tamed to
me.
'Jane, yon will wonder at ns and oar mysteriea,'she
said,'and think us hard-hearted beings not to be more
moved at the death of so near a relation as an nnde ; bat we
have never seen him or known him. He was my mother's
brother. My father and he quarrelled long ago. It was by
his advice that my father risked most of his property in the
I speculation that ruined him. Mutual recrimination passed
between them : they parted in'anger, and were never reoon-
j oiled. My uncle engaged afterwards in more prosperous
undertakings : it appears he realised a foitune of twenty
thousand pounds. He was never married, and had no near
kindred but ourselves, and one. other person, not more
closely related than we. My father always cherished the

I queaihed every penny to the other relation; with, the
I exception of thirty guineas, to be divided between Si'John,
j Diana, and Mary Bivers, for the purchase of three mourning
I rings. He had a right, of course, to do as he pleased : and
yet a momentary damp is cast on the spirits by the receipt
of such news. Mary and I would have esteemed ourselves
rich with a thousand pounds each ; and to St. John such a
sum would have been valuable, for the good it would have
enabled him to do.'
This explanation given, the subject was dropped, and no
further reference made to it, by either Mr. Bivers or his
sTsters. The next day I left Marsh End for Morton. The
day after, Diana and Mary quitted it for distant B .
In a week, Mr. Bivers and Hannah repaired to the parson-
age : and so the old grange was abandoned.

Mt home, then, — when I at last find a home, — is a cottage :
a little room with white-washed walls and a sanded floor;
containing four painted chairs and a table, a clock, a cup-
board, with two or three plates and dishes, and a set of tea-
things in delf. Above, a chamber of the same dimensions as
the kitchen, with a deal bedstead, and chest of drawers;
small, yet too large to be fiUed with my scanty wardrobe :
though tiie kindness of my gentle and generous friends has
increased that by a modest stock of such things as are
necessary.
It is evening. I have dismissed, with the fee of an
orange, the little orphan who serves me as a handmaid. I
am sitting alone on the hearth. This morning the village
school opened. I had twenty scholars. But three of the
number can read : none write or cypher. Several knit, and
a few sew a little. They speak with the broadest accent of
the district. At present they and I have'a difficulty in
understanding each other's language. Some of them are
unmannered, rough, intractable, as well as ignorant; but
others are docile, have a wish to learn, and evince a dis-
position ihat pleases me. I must not forget that these
coarsely-clad little peasants are of flesh and blood as good
as the scions of gentlest genealogy ; and that the germs of
native excellence, refinement, intelligence, kind feeling, are
as likely to eidst in their hearts as in those of the best-bom.
My duty will be to develop these germs : surely I shall find
some happiness in discharging that office. Muc^ enjoyment
I do not expect in the life opening before me : yet it will,

doubiless, if I regulate my mind, and ezerl my powers as I
ought, yidd me enough to liye on bom day to day. .
Was I yery gleeful, settled, content^ during the homrs I
passed in yonder bare, humble school-room this m < Mrmng and
afternoon 7 Not to deceive myself, I most reply — No : I
felt desolate to a degree. I felt— yes, idiot that I am — ^I Idl
degraded. I doubted I had taken a step which sank instead
of raising me in the scale of sodal existence. I was weakly
dismayed at the ignorance, the poverty, the coarseness of all
I heard and saw round, me. But let me not hate and despise
myself too much for these feelings: I know them to be wrong
—that is a great step gained ; I shall strive to overcome thttn.
To-morrow, I trust, I shall get the better of them partially ;
and in a few weeks, perhaps, they will be quite subdued. In
a few months, it is possible, the happness of seeing progress,
and a change for the better in my scholars, may snbstitate
gratification for disgust
Meantime, let me ask myself one question — Which is
better? — ^To have surrendered to temptation listened to
passion ; made no painful effort — ^no struggle ;-'but to have
sunk down in the ^ken snare ; fallen asleep on the flowers
covering it; wakened in a southern dime, amongst the
luxuries of a pleasure villa : to have been now living in
France, Mr. Bochester's mistress ; delirious with his love
half my time — for he would — oh, yes, he would have loved
me well for a while. He did love me — no one will ever love
me so again. I shall never more know the sweet homage
given to beauty, youth, and grace— for never to any one else
shall I seem to possess these charms. He was fond and
proud of me — it is what no man besides will ever be. — But
where am I wandering, and what am I saying ; and, above
all, feeling 7 Whether is it better, I ask, to be a slave in a
fool's paradise at Marseilles— fevered with delusive bliss one
hour— suffocating with the bitterest tears of remorse and
shame the next— or to be a village schoolmistress, free and
honest, in a breezy mountain nook in the healthy heart of
England?

Yes; I feel now ihat I was right when I adhered to
principle and law, and Boomed and crushed the insane
promptings of a frenzied moment God directed me to a
correct choice : I thank His providence for the guidance.
Having brought my eventide mudngs to this pointi Irose,
went to my door, and looked at the sunset of the harvest-day,
and at the quiet fields before my cottage; which, with the
school, was distant half a mile from the village. . The birds
were singing their last strains —
The air was mild ; the dew was balm.
While I looked, I thought myself happy, and was surprised
to find myself ere long weeping — and why? For the doom
which had reft me from adhesion to my master : for him I
was no more to see; for the desperate grief and fatal
fury — consequences of my departure — which might now,
perhaps, be dragging him from the path of right, too far to
leave hope of ultimate restoration thither. At this thougbti
I turned my face aside from the lovely sky of eve and lonely
vale of Morton— I say landy, for in that bend of it visible to
me there was no building apparent save the church and the
parsonage, half -hid in trees; and, quite at the extremity,
the roof of Vale Hall, where the rich Mr. Oliver and hit
daughter lived. I hid my eyes, and leant my head against
the stone frame of my door ; but soon a slight noise near
the wicket which shut in my tiny garden from the meadow
beyond it made me look up. A dog— old Carlo, Mr. Biveri'
pointer, as I saw in a moment — was pushing the gate with
his nose, and St. John himself leant upon it with folded arms;
his brow knit, his gaze, grave almost to ^spleasure, fixed oo
me. I asked him to come in
'No, I cannot stay ; I have only brought you a little
parcel my sisters left for you. I think it contains a colour-
box, pencUs, and paper.'
I approached to take it: a welcome gift.it was. He
examined my face, I thought, with austerity, as I came near:
the traces of tears were doubtless very visible upon it.

the mindf as strong as the {orbiddenfrait it longed to laste^
and perhaps purer ; and to hew out for the adventurous foot
a road as direct and broad as the one Fortune has blocked up
against us, if rougher than it.
'A year ago I was myself intensely miserable, because
I thought I had made a mistake in entering the ministry : its
uniform duties wearied me to death. I burnt for the more
active life of the world — for the more exciting toils of a
literary career — ^for the destiny of an artist, author, orator;
anything rather than that of a priest : yes, the heart of a
politician, of a soldier, of a votary of glory, a lover of renown,
a luster after power, beat under my curate's surplice. I
considered ; my life was so wretched, it must be chuiged, or
I must die. After a season of darkness and struggling, light
broke and relief feU : my cramped existence all at once
spread out to a plain without bounds — ^my powers heard a
call from heaven to rise, gather their full strength, spread
their wings, and mount beyond ken. Qoi, had an errand for
me ; to bear which afar, to deliver it weU, skill and strength,
courage and eloquence, the best qualifications of soldier,
statesman, and orator, were all needed : for these all centre
in the good missionary.
'A missionary I resolved to be. From that moment my
state of mind changed; the fetters dissolved and dropped
from every faculty, leaving nothing of bondage but its gaJUng
soreness — which time only can heal My father, indeed,
opposed the determination, but since his death I have not a
legitimate obstacle to contend with ; some affairs settled, a
successor for Morton provided, an entanglement or two of
the feelings broken through or cut asunder — a last conflict
with human weakness, in which I know I shall overcome,
because I have vowed that I toiU overcome — and I leave
Europe for the East'
He said this in his peculiar, subdued, yet emphatic voice ;
looking, when he had ceased speaking, not at me, but at the
setting sun, at which I looked too. Both he and I had our
backs towards the path leading up the field to the wicket

ninmng in the vale was the one lulling sound of the hour
and soene ; we might well then start when a gay ymob,
sweet as a silver bell, exclaimed :—'Grood evenings Mr. BiYera.
And good evening, old Carlo. Your dog is quieker to

and wagged his tail when I was at the boliom of the field,

vision, as it seemed to me, had risen at his side. There
appeared, within three feet of him, a form dad in pure
white — a youthful, graceful form : full, yet fine in contour ;
and when, after bending to caress Carlo, it lifted up its head,
and threw back a long veil, there bloomed under his glance a
face of perfect beauty. Perfect beauty is a strong expressioii ;
but I do not retrace or qualify it : as sweet features as ever
the temperate clime of Albion moulded ; as pure hues of rose
and lily as ever her humid gales and vapoury
and screened justified, in this instance, the tenn. No charm
was wanting, no defect was perceptible ; the young girl had
regular and delicate lineaments ; eyes shaped and coloured
as we see them in lovely pictures, large, and dark, and full ;
the long and shadowy eyelash which encircles a fine eye
with so soft a fascination ; the pencilled brow which gives
Buch clearness; the white, smooth forehead, which adds
Buch repose to the livelier beauties of tint and ray ; the cheek,
oval, fresh, and smooth ; the lips, fresh too, ruddy, healthy,
sweetly formed ; the even and gleaming teeth without fiaw ;
the small dimpled chin ; the ornament of rich, plenteons
tresses — all advantages, in short, which, combined, realise
the ideal of -beauty were fully hers. I wondered, as I looked
at this fair creature: I admired her with my whole

heart. Nature had surely formed her hi a partial mood;
and, forgettmg her usual stinted stepmother dole o£ gifts,
had endowed this, her darling, with a granddame's bounty.
What did St. John Rivers think of this earthly angel ? I
naturally asked myself that question as I saw him turn to
her and look at her ; and, as naturally, I sought the answer
to the inquiry in his coimtenance. He had abready with-
drawn his eye from the Peri, and was looking at a humble
tuft of daisies which grew by the wicket.
'A lovely evening, but late for you to be out alone,'he
said, as he crushed the snowy heads of the. closed flowers
with his foot
'Oh, I only came home from S'(she mentioned the
name of a lajrge town some- twenty miles distant)'this
afternoon. Papa told me you had opened your school, and
that the new mistress was come ; and so I put on my bonnet
after tea, and ran up the valley to see her : this is she?'
pointing to me.

'Do you think you shall like Morton?'she asked of me.,
with a direct and naive simplicity of tone and manner,
pleasing, if child-like.
'I hope I shall. I have many inducements to do so.'
'Did you find your scholars as attentive as you expected 7 *

* Do you like your house 7*
'Very much.'
'Have I furnished it nicely 7'
* Very nicely indeed.'
'And made a good choice of an attendant for you in
AUceWood?'
'You have, indeed. She is teachable and handy.'(This,
then, I thought, is Miss Oliver, the heiress; favoured,
it seems, in the gifts of fortune, as well as in those of nature !
What happy combination of the planets presided over her
birth, I wonder 7)

added.'It will be a change tor me to vint yoa now and

ing, I was dancing till two o'dook. The th repmeni

most agreeable men in the world : they pat all oar yoong
knife-grinders and scissor merchants to shame.'
It seemed to me that Mr. St. John's ander lip protraded,
and his upper lip curled a moment. His mouth oertainly
looked a good deal compressed, and the lower part of his
face unusually stem and square, as the laughing girl gave
him this information. He lifted his gaze, too, from the
daisies, and turned it on her. An unsmiling, a'searohing, a
meaning gaze it was. * She answered it with a second laa^
and laughter well became her youth, her roses, her dimples,
her bright eyes.
As he stood, mute and grave, she again fell to oaressing
Carlo.
'Poor Carlo loves me,* said she.'He is not stem and
distant to his friends ; and if he could speak, he would nol
be silent.*
As she patted the dog's head, bending with native graoe
before his young and austere master, I saw a glow rise to
that master's face. I saw his solenm eye melt with
sudden fire, and flicker with resistless emotion. Hushed
and kindled thus, he looked nearly as beautiful for a man
as she for a woman. His chest heaved once, as if his
large heart, weary of despotic constriction, had expanded,
despite the will, and made a vigorous bound for the attain-
ment of liberty. But he curbed it, I think, as a resolata
rider would curb a rearing steed. He responded neither
by word nor movement. to the gentle advances made
him.
'Papa says you never come to see us now,* continued
Miss Oliver, looking up.'You are quite a stranger at Valo
Hall. He is alone this evening, and not very well : will yoa
return witti me and visit him ? *

* It is not a seasonable boor to intrade on Mr. Oliyer/
answered Si John.
* Not a seasonable hour I But I declare it is. It is jnst
the hour when papa most wants company : when the woiks
are dosed, and he has no business to occupy him. Now,
Mr. Biyers, do come. Why are yon so very shy, and so very
sombre?*
She filled up the hiatus his silence left by a reply of her
own.
'I forgot I'she exclaimed, shaking her beautiful curled
head, as if shocked at herself.'I am so giddy and thought-
less I Do excuse me. It had slipped my memory that you
have good reasons to be indisposed for joining in my chatter.
Diana and Mary have left you, and Moor House is shut up,
and you are so lonely. I am sure I pity you. Do come and
see papa.*
* Not to-night, Ifiss Bosamond, not to-nig|il*
Mr. St. John spoke almost like an automaton : himself
only knew the effort it cost him thus to refuse.
* Well« if you are so obstinate, I will leave you ; for I dare
not stay any longer : the dew begins to fall. Oood-evening I'
She held out her hand. He just touched it.'Oood-

She turned ; but in a moment returned.
'Are you well?'she asked. Well might she put the
question : his face was blanched as her gown.
'Quite well,'he enunciated ; and, with a bow, he left the
gate. She went one way ; he another. She turned twice to
gaze after him, as she tripped fairy-like down the field ; he,
as he strode firmly across, never turned at alL
This spectacle of another's suffering and sacrifice rapt
my thoughts from exclusive meditation on my own. Diana
Bivers had designated her brother'inexorable as death.'She

I ooNTiNUED the labotm of the villagd-sbhool as aottvety
and faithfully as I ooulcL It was truly hard work at firsi.
Some time elapsed before, with all my efforts, I coold
comprehend my scholars and their nature. Wholly untaught^
with faculties quite torpid, they seemed to m^ hopelessly
dull ; and, at first sights all dull alike : but I soon found I
was mistaken. There was a difference amongst tfaem a«
amongst the educated ; and when I got to know them, and
they me, this difference rapidly developed itaeU. Their
amazement at me, my language, my rules, and ways, onoe'
subsided, I found some of these heavy-looking, gaping mstios
wake up into sharp-witted girls enough Many showed
themselves obliging, and amiable too; and I discovered
amongst them not a few examples of natural politeness and
innate self-respect, as well as of excellent capacity, that won
both my goodwill and my admiration. These soon took a
pleasure in doing their work well ; in keeping their persons
neat; in learning their tasks regularly; in acquiring quiet
and orderly manners. The rapidity of their progress, in
some instances, was even surprising; and an honest and
happy pride I took in it : besides, I began personally to like
some of the best girls ; and they liked me. I had amongst
my scholars several farmers'daug|iters: young women
grown, almost These could already read, write, and sew ;
and to them I taught the elements df gnunmar, geography,
history, and the finer kinds of needlework. I found estimaUa
characters amongst them — characters desirous of infor-
mation, and disposed for improvement — with whom I passed
many a pleasant evening hour in their own homes. Their

parents ihen (the farmer and his wife) loaded me with
attentions. There was an enjoyment in accepting their
simple kindness, and in repaying it by a consideration — a
sompnlous regard to their feelings — ^to which they were not,
perhaps, at all times aocnstomed, and which botii charmed
and benefited them ; because, while it elevated them in their
own eyes, it made them emulous to merit the deferential
treatment they receiyed.
I felt I became a favourite in the neighbourhood. When-
ever I went out, I heard on all sides cordial salutations, and
was welcomed with friendly smiles. To live amidst general
regard, though it be but the regard of working-people, is like
* sitting in sunshine, calm and sweet:'serene inward
feelings bud and Uoom under the ray. At this period of my
life my heart far oftener swelled with thankfulness than
sank with dejection : and yet, reader, to tell you aUt in the
'midst of this calm, this useful existence — after a day passed
in honourable exertion amongst my scholars, an evening
spent in drawing or reading contentedly alone — ^I used to
rush into strange dreams at night : dreams many-coloured,
agitated, full of the ideal, the stirring, the stormy— dreams
where, amidst unusual scenes, charged with adventure, with
agitating risk and romantic chance, I still again and again
met Mr. Rochester, always at some exciting crisis ; and then
the sense of being in his arms, hearing his voice, meeting his
eye, touching his hand and cheek, loving him, being loved by
him — the hope of passing a lifetime at his side, would be
renewed, with all its first force and fire. Then I awoke.
Then I recalled where I was, and how situated. Then I
rose up on my curtainless bed, trembling and quivering;
and then the still, dark night witnessed the convulsion of
despair and heard the burst of passion. By nine o'clock the
next morning I was punctually opening the school ; tranquil,
settled, prepared for the steady duties of the day.
Rosamond Oliver kept her word in coming to visit me.
Her call at the school was generally made in the course of
her morning ride. She would canter up to the door on her

pony, followed by a mounted liyery Benrani. Anytihiiig man
exquisite than her appearance, in her purple haUt^ with her
Amazon's cap of black Telvel placed gracefully above the
bog curls ihat kissed her cheek and floated toherahoalders,
can scarcely be imagined : and it was thus she would enter
the rustic building, and glide through the daaaled ranks of
the village children. She generally came at the hour when
Mr. Bivers was engaged in giving his dafly catftchiang
lesson. Keenly, I fear, d.d the eye of the Waitress pierce the
young pastor's heart A sort of instinct seemed to warn him
of her entrance, even when he did not see it ; and when he
was looking quite away from the door, if she appeared at it his
cheek would glow and his marble-seeming features, thou^
they refused to relax, changed indescribably : and in their very
quiescence became expressive of a repressed fervour, stronger
than working muscle or darting glance could indicate.
Of course she knew her power: indeed, he did nol^
because he could not, conceal it from her. In spite of his
Christian stoicism, when she went up and addressed him, and
smiled gaily, encouragingly, even fondly in his face, his hand
would tremble and his eye bum. He seemed to say, with
his sad and resolute look, if he did not say it with his lipe,
* I love you, and I know you prefer me. It is not despair of
success that keeps me dumb. If I offered my heart, I believe
you would accept it. But that heart is already laid on a
sacred altar : the fire is arranged roimd it. It will soon be
no more than a sacrifice consumed.'
And then she would pout like a disappointed child ; a
pensive cloud would soften her radiant vivacity ; she would
withdraw her hand hastily from his, and turn in transient
petulance from his aspect, at once so heroic and so martyr-
like. St. John, no doubt, would have given the world to follow,
recall, retain her, when she thus left him : but he would not
give one chance of Heaven ; nor relinquish, for the elysium
of her love, one hope of the true, eternal Paradise. Besides,
he could not bound all that he had in his nature — the rover,
the aspirant, the poet, the priest — in the limits of a single

passion. He could not — he would not — renounce his wild
field of mission warfare for the parlours and the peace of
Vale HalL I learnt so much from himself, in an inroad I
once, despite his reserye, had the daring to make on his
confidence.
Miss Oliver already honoured me with frequent visits to
my cottage. I had learnt her whole character ; which was
without mystery or disguise : she was coquettish, but not
heartless; exacting, but not worthlessly selfi^. She had
been indulged from her birth, but was not absolutely spoilt
She was hasty, but good-humoured ; vain (she could not
help it, when every glance in the glass showed her such a
flu^ of loveliness), but not affected ; liberal-hatred ; innocent
of the pride of wealth; ingenuous; sufficiently intelligent;
gay, Uyely, and unthinking: she was very charming, in
short, even to a cool observer of her own sex like me ; but
she was not profoundly interesting or thoroughly impressive.
A very different sort of mind was hers from that, for instance,
of the sisters of St. John. Still, I liked her almosV^as I liked
my pupil AdMe : except that for a child whom we have
watched over and taught a closer affection is engendered
than we can give an equally attractive adult acquaintance.
She had taken an amiable caprice to me. She said I
was like Mr. Biver^ (only, certainly, she allowed,'not one-
tenth so handsome : though I was a nice neat little soul
enough, but he was an angel *). I was, however, good, clever,
composed, and firm, like him. I was a hisus natura, she
affirmed, as a village schoolmistress : she was sure my
previous history, if known, would make a delightful
romance.
One evening while, with her usual childlike activity,
and thoughtless yet not offensive inquisitiveness, she was
rummaging the cupboard and the table-drawer of my little
kitchen, she discovered first two French books, a volume of
Schiller, a German grammar and dictionary ; and then my
drawing-materials and some sketches, including a pencil-
head of a pretty little cherub-like girl, one of my scholars,

and sundry views from natarey taken in ihe Yale of ICortoa
and on the snrronnding moors. She was first iranefized
\rith surprise, and then electrified with delight.
'Had I done these pictures? Did I know Breneh and
German? What a love^what a miracle I was I I drew
better than her master in the fiorst school in S . Would
I sketch a portrait qI her, to show to papa?*
'With pleasure,* I replied; and I felt a thrill of artist-
delight at tiie idea of copying from so perfect and radiant a
model She had then on a dark-blue silk dress; her arms
and her neck were bare ; her only ornament was her ohesnnt
tresses, which waved over her shoulders with all the wild
grace of natural curls. I took a sheetof fine cardboardt and
drew a careful outline.'I promised myself the pleasure of
colouring it ; and, as it was getting late then, I told her she
must come and sit another day.
She made such a report of me to her father that Mr.
Oliver himself accompanied her next evening— a tall,
massive-featured, middle-aged, and grey-headed man, at
whose side his lovely daughter looked like a bright flower
near a hoary turret. He appeared a taciturn, and perhaps a
proud personage ; but he was very kind to me. The sketch
of Bosamond's portrait pleased him highly : he said I must
make a finish^ picture of it. He insisted, too, on my
coming the next day to spend the evening at Yale HalL
I went. I found it a large, handsome residence, showing
abundant evidences of wealth in the proprietor. Bosamond
was full of glee and pleasure all the time I stayed. Her
father was affable; and when he entered into conversation
with me after tea, he expressed in strong terms his approba-
tion of what I had done in Morton school ; and said he only
feared, from what he saw and heard, I was too good for the
place, and would soon quit it for one more suitable.
'Indeed I'cried Bosamond,'she is clever enough to be a
governess in a high family, papa.'
I thought — I would far rather be where I am than in any
high family in the land. Mr. Oliver spoke of Mr. Bivers-^
\
„ I ■ 11 ■■III t


ifia JANB ETBB
of ihe Kvers family — with great respect. He said it was a
very old name in that neighbourhood ; that the ancestors of
the house were wealthy ; that all Morton had once belonged
to them , that even now he considered the representative of
that house might, if he liked, make an alliance with the best.
He accounted it a pity that so fine and talented a young man
should have formed the design of going out as a missionary ;
it was quite thowing a valuable life away. It appeared, theoi
that her father would throw no obstacle in the way of
Bosamond's union with St John. Mr. Oliver evidently
regarded the young clergyman's good birth, old name, and
sacred profession as sufi & oient compensation for the want of
fortune.
It was the 5th of November, and a holidjiy. My little
servant, after helping me to dean my house, vras gone, well
satisfied with the fee of a penny for her aid. All about me
was spotless and bright — scoured floor, polished grate, and
well-rubbed chairs. I had also made myself neat, and had
now the afternoon before me to spend as I would.
The translation of a few pages of German occupied an
hour ; then I got my palette and pencils, and fell to the more
soothing, because easier occupation, of completing Rosamond
Oliver's miniature. The head was finished already: there
was but the background to tint and the drapery to shade off;
a touch of carmine, too, to add to the ripe lips — a soft curl
here and there to the tresses — a deeper tinge to the shadow
of the lash under the azured eyelid. I was absorbed in the
execution of these nice details when, after one rapid tap, my
door unclosed, admitting Si John Rivers.
1 1 am come to see how you are spending your holiday/
he said.'Not, I hope, in thought ? No, that is well : while
you draw you will not feel lonely. You see, I mistrust yon
still : though you have borne up wonderfully so tar. I have
brought you a book for evening solace,'and he laid on the
table a new publication — a poem: one of those genuine
productions so often vouchsafed to the fortunate public of
those days— the golden age of modem literature. Alaa I the

not pause either to accuse or repine. I know poetry is not
dead, nor genius lost ; nor has Mammon gained power over
either, to bind or slay : they will both assert their existence,
their presence, their liberty and strength again one day.
Powerful angels, safe in heaven I they smile when sordid soida
triumph, and feeble ones weep over their destraetion. Poetry
destroyed? OeniuiB banished? Not Mediooriiyy no: do
not let envy prompt you to the thought. No ; they not only
live, but reign, and redeem: and without their divine
influence spread ieverywhere you would be in hell — the hell
ij ] of your own meanness.
While I was eagerly glancing at the bright pages of
Marmion (for Marmion it was) St. John stooped to examine
my drawing. His tall figure sprang erect again with a start :
he said nothing. I looked up at him : he shunned my eye.
I knew his thoughts well, and could read his heart plainly;
at the moment I felt calmer and cooler than he : I had then
temporarily the advantage of him; and I conceived an
inclination to do him some good, if I could.
'With all his firmness and self-control,'thought I, * be
tasks himself too far : locks every feeling and pang within —
expresses, confesses, imparts nothing. I am sure it would
benefit him to talk a little about this sweet Bosamond, whom
he thinks he ought not to marry : I will make him talk.'
I said first :'Take a chair, Mr. Rivers.'But he answered,
f ^ ] as he always did, that he could not stay.'Very well»'I
responded, mentally,'stand if you Uke ; but you shall not
go just yet, I am determined : solitude is at least as b^d
i ,'1 for you as it is for me. I'll try if I cannot discover the
i I secret spring of your confidence, and find an aperture in that
j I ^ marble breast through which I can shed one drop of the balm
'-'] , of sympathy.'
I'Is this portrait like ?'I asked bluntly.
'like ! like whom ? I did not obs^e it closely/
• Ton did, Mr. Rivers.'
He almost started at my sudden and strange abruptness :

he looked at me astonished.'Oh, that is nothing 3^t»'I
mnttered within. «I don't mean to be baffled by a little
stiffness on your part ; I'm prepared to go to considerable
lengths.'I continued, * Yon observed it closely and dis-
tinctly : but I haye no objection to your looking at it again/
and I rose and placed it in his hand.
'A well-executed picture/ he said ;'very soft, dear colour-
ing ; very graceful and correct drawing.'
'Yes, yes ; I know all that. But what of the resemblance ?
Who is it like?'
Mastering some hesitation, he answered,'Miss Oliver, I
presume.'
'Of course. And now, sir, to reward you for the accurate
guess I vnll promise to paint you a careful and faithful
duplicate of this very picture, provided you admit that the
gift would be acceptable to you. I don't wish to throw away
my time and trouble on an offering you would deem worth-
less.'
He continued to gaze at the picture : the longer he looked,
the firmer he held it, the more he seemed to covet it.'It is
like !'he murmured ;'the eye is well managed : the colour,
light, expression, are perfect. It smiles !'
'Would it comfort or would it wound you to have a
similar painting ? Tell me that When you are at Mada-
gascar, or at the Cape, or in India, would it be a consolation
to have that memento in your possession ? or would the sight
of it bring recollections calculated to enervate and dis-
tress?'
He now furtively raised his eyes: he glanced at me,
irresolute, disturbed ; he again surveyed the picture.
'That I should like to have it is certain : whether it
would be judicious or wise is another question.'
Since I had ascertained that Bosamond really preferred
him, and that her father was not likely to oppose the match,
I — less exalted in my views than St. John — had been strongly
disposed in my own heart to advocate their union. It seemed
to me that, should he become the possessor of Mr. Oliver's

large fortune, he might do as much good with it as if he
went and laid his genius out to wither and his strength to
waste under a tropical sun. With this persuasion I now
answered: —'As far asl cansee, it would be wiser andmoie
III 1 judicious if you were to take to yourself the orig^lal at
^ ■ onoe.'
By this time he had sat down : he had laid the {nctoreon
the table before him, and with his brow supported on both
hands hung fondly over it. I discerned he was now neither
angry nor shocked at my audacity. I saw even that to be thus
frankly addressed on a subject he had deemed unapproach-.
able — to hear it thus freely handled — was beginning to be
felt by him as a new pleasure — an unhoped-for relieL
Reserved people often really need the frank discussion of
their sentiments and griefs more than the expansive. The
sternest- seeming stoic is human after aU; and to'burst'
with boldness and goodwill into'the silent sea * of their
souls is often to confer on them the first of oUigationa.
'She likes you, I am sure/ said I, as I stood behind his
chair,'and her father respects you. Moreover, she is a sweet
girl — rather thoughtless; but you would have sufficient
thought for both yourself and her. You ought to marry
her.'
'Does she like me ?'he asked.
'Certainly; better than she likes any one else. She
talks of you continually : there is no subject she enjoys so
much or touches upon so often.'
'It is very pleasant to hear this,'he said —'very : go on
for another quarter of an hour.'And he actually took oat
his watch and laid it upon the table to measure the time.
'But where is the use of going on,'I asked,'when yoa
are probably preparing some iron blow of contradiction, or
forging a fresh chain to fetter your heart ?'
'Don't imagine such hard things. Fkncy me yielding
and melting, as I am doing : human love rising like a freshly
opened foimtain in my mind and overflowing with sweet
inundation all the field I have so carefully, and with such

labour prepared — so assiduously sown with the seeds of good
intentions, of self-denying plajis. And now it is deluged
with a nectarous flood — ^the young germs swamped — delioious
poison cankering them : now I see myself stretched on an
ottoman in the drawing-room at Vale Hall« at my bride
Bosamond Oliver's feet : she is talking to me with her sweet
voice — ^gazing down on me with those eyes your skilful hand
has copied so well — smiling at me with these coral lips. She
is mine — I am hers — ^this present life and passing world
suffice to me. Hush I say nothing — ^my heart is full of delight
— my senses are entranced — let the time I marked pass in
peace.*
I humoured him : the watch ticked on : he breathed fast
and low: I stood silent. Amidst this hush the quarter
sped; he replaced the watch, laid the picture down, rose,
and stood on the hearth.
'Now,'said he, * that little space was g^ven to delirium
and delusion. I rested my temples on the breast of tempta-
tion, and put my neck voluntarily under her yoke of flowers ;
I tasted her cup. The pillow vras burning ; there is an asp
in the garland ; the wine has a bitter taste ; her promises
are hollow — her offers false ; I see and know all this.'
I gazed at him in wonder.
* It is strange,'pursued he,'that while I love Bosamond
Oliver so wildly — with all the intensity, indeed, of a first
passion, the object of which is exquisitely beautiful, grace-
ful, and fascinating — I experience at the same time a calm,
imwarped consciousness that she would not make me a
good wife ; that she is not the partner suited to me ; that I
should discover this within a year after marriage ; and that
to twelve months'rapture would succeed a lifetime of regret
This I know.'
'Strange, indeed I'I could not help ejaculating.
'While something in me,'he went on,'is acutely sensible
to her charms, something else is as deeply impressed with
her defects; they are such that she could sympathise in
nothing I aspired to — oo-operate in nothing I undertook.

Again the surprised expression crossed his foce. He had

could never rest in communication with strong, discreet, and
refined minds, whether male or female, till I had passed the
outworks of conventional reserve, and crossed the threshold
of confidence, and won a place by their heart's very hearth-
stone.

He drew over the picture the sheet of thin paper oi
whioh I was aooustomed to rest my band in painting tc
prevent the cardboard from being sullied. What hi
suddenly saw on this blank paper it was imposuble tar nu
to tell : but something bad caught his eye. Ha took it qj
with a snatch ; he looked at the edge ; then shot a glaooe ftl
me, inexpressibly peculiar and quite inoomprebeDsiUe : ■
glance that seemed to take and make note of every point u
my shape, face, and dress ; for it traversed all, quick, keen ai
lightning. His lips parted, as if to speak : but he checked
the coming sentence, whatever it was.
'What is the matter?'I asked.
'Nothing in the world,'waa the reply ; and, replaettm
the paper, I saw him dexterously tear a narrow slip fzom the
margin. It disappeared in his glove ; and, with one hasty
nod and'good-afternoon,'he vanished.
'Well t'I exclaimed, using an expression of the dlsttiot,
'that caps the globe, however I'

When Mr. St. John went it was beginning to snow; the
whirling storm continued all night. The next day a keen
wind brought fresh and blinding falls; by twilighlf the
valley was drifted up and almost impassable. I had closed
my shutter, laid a mat to the door to prevent the snow
from blowing in under it, trimmed my fire, and after sitting
nearly an hour on the hearth listening to the mu£9ed
fury of the tempest, I lit a candle, took down Marmion, and
banning —
Day let on Norham'i cMUed fteep,
And TwiBed'i fair river broad and deep.
And Cheriot'e monntaini lone ;
The massive towers, the donjon keep.
The flanking walls that roond them sweep.
In yellow lustre shone,
I soon forgot storm in music.
I heard a noise : the wind, I thought, shook the door.
No; it was St. John Bivers, who, lifting the latch, came
in out of the frozen hurricane — the howling darkness—
and stood before me : the cloak that covered his tall figure
all white as a glacier. I was almost in consternation ; so
little had I expected any guest from the blocked-up vale
that night.
'Any ill news ?'I demanded.'Has anything
happened ?'
'No. How very easily alarmed you are !'he answered,
removing his cloak and hanging it up agunst the door,
towards which he again coolly pushed the mat which his
entrance had deranged. He staonped the snow from his
boots.

'I sliall snlly the parity of yoor floor/ said he,'bat
you most exonse me for once.'Then he approached die
fire :'I have had hard work to get here» I assure you.*
he observed, as he warmed his hands over the flame.'One
drift took me np to the waist; happily the snow is quite
soft yet.'
'But why are you come?'I could not foibear saying.
'Bather an inhospitable question to put to a visitor; but
since you ask it, I answer simply to have a little talk with
you; I got tired of my mute books and empty rooms.
Besides, since yesterday I have experienced the excitement
of a person to whom a tale has been half -told* and who is
impatient to hear the sequeL'
He sat down. I recalled his singular conduct of jrester-
day, and really I began to fear his wits were touched. If
he were insane, however, his was a very cool and collected
insanity : I had never seen that handsome-featured face of
his look more like chiselled marble than it did just now, as
he put aside his snow-vEret hair from his forehead and lei
the firelight shine free on his pale brow and cheek as pale,
where it grieved me to discover the hollow trace of care or
sorrow now so plainly graved. I waited, expecting he
would say something I could at least comprehend ; but his
hand was now at his chin, his finger on his lip: he was
thinking. It struck me that his hand looked wasted like his
face. A perhaps uncalled-for gush of pity came over my
heart : I was moved to say : —'I wish Diana or Mary would
come and live with you : it is too bad that you should be
quite alone ; and you are recklessly rash about your own
health.'
'Not at all,'said he :'I care for myself when necessary;
I am well now. What do you see amiss in me?'
This was said with a careless, abstracted indifference,
which showed that my solicitude was, at least in his opinicii,
wholly superfluous. I was silenced.
He still slowly moved his finger over his upper lip,
and still his eye dwelt dreamily on the glowing grate.

Thinking it nrgent to say something, I asked him presently
if he felt any cold draught from the door, which was behind
him.
'No, no/ he responded, shortly and somewhat testily.
'Well/ I reflected,'if yon won't talk, yon may be still ;
m let yon alone now, and return to my book.'
So I snuffed the candle, and resumed the perusal of
Marmion. He soon stirred ; my eye was instantly drawn to
his movements ; he only took out a morocco pocket-book,
thence produced a letter, which he read in silence, folded it,
put it back, relapsed into meditation. It was vain to try to
read with such an inscrutable fixture before me ; nor could
I, in my impatience, consent to be dumb ; he might rebuff
me if he liked, but talk I would.
'Hare you heard from Diana and Mary lately? *
* Not since the letter I showed you a week ago.*
* There has not been any change made about your own
arrangements ? You will not be siunmoned to leave England
sooner than you expected ?'
'I fear not, indeed : such chance is too good to befall me.'
Baffled so far I changed my ground — I bethought myself to
talk about the school and my scholars.
'Mary Garrett's mother is better, and Mary came back to
the school this morning, and I shall have four new girls
next week from the Foundry Close — they would have come
to-day but for the snow.'
'Indcedl'
* Mr. Oliver pays for two.*
'Does he?'
'He means to give the whole school a treat at Christmas.'
* I know.'
* Was it your suggestion?'
* No.'
* Whose, then ?'
* His daughter's, I think*
'It is like her : she is so good-natured.'

Again came the blank of a pause : ihe dock stmok right
strokes. It aroused him ; he uncrossed his legs^ sat eieclk
turned to me.
'Leave your book a moment^ -and come a little naazer the
fire,'he said.
Wondering, and of my wonder finding no end, I complied.
'Half an hour ago,'he pursued,'I spoke of my impatience
to hear the sequel of a tale : on reflection, I find the matter
will be better managed by my assuming the narrator's pait^
and converting you into a listener. Before coounencing it
is but fair to warn you that the story will sound somewhat
hackneyed in your ears: but stale details often regain a
degree of freshness when they pass through new lips, fbr
the rest, whether trite or novel, it is short
'Twenty years ago a poor curate — never mind his name
at this moment — ^f ell in love with a rich man's daughter ; she
fell in love with him, and married him, against the advice of
all her friends ; who consequently disowned her immediately
after the wedding. Before two years passed the rash pair
were both dead, and laid quietly side by side under one slab.
(I have seen their grave ; it formed part of the pavement of
a huge churchyard surrounding the grim, soot-black old
cathedral of an overgrown manufacturing town in shire.
They left a daughter, which, at its very birth, Charity received
in her lap — cold as that of the snow-drift I almost stuck
fast in to-night. Charity carried the friendless thing to the
house of its rich maternal relations ; it was reared by an
aunt-in-law called (I come to names now) Mrs. Beed, of
Gateshead — you start — did you hear a noise ? I daresay it
is only a rat scrambling along the rafters of the adjoining
schooLroom : it was a bam before J had it repaired and
altered, and barns are generally haunted by rats. — ^To proceed.
Mrs. Beed kept the orphan ten years : whether it was happy
or not with her I cannot say, never having been told ; but at
the end of that time she transferred it to a place you know —
being no other than Lowood School, where you so long
resided yourself. It seems her career there vras very honour-

able: from a puinl she became a teacher, like yoturself —
really it etrikes me there are parallel points in her history
and yours — she left it to be a governess : there, again, your
fates were analogous ; she undertook the education of the
ward of a certain Mr. Bochester/
'Mr. Kvers I * I interrupted. .
* I can guess your feelings/ he said,'but restrain them
for a while: I have nearly finished ; hear me to the end. Of
Mr. Bochester's character I know nothing, but the one fact
that he professed to ofiFer honourable marriage to this young
girl, and that at the very altar she discovered he had a wife
yet alive, though a lunatia What his subsequent conduct
and proposals were is a matter of pure conjecture; but when
an event transpired which rendered inquiiy after the
governess necessary, it was discovered she was gone — no one
could tell when, where, or how. She had left Thomfield
Hall in the night ; every research after her course had been
vain : the country had been scoured farand vride; no vestige
of information could be gathered respecting her. Tet that
she should be found is become a matter of serious urgency :
advertisements have been put in all the papers ; I myself
have received a letter from one Mr. Briggs, a solicitor, com-
municating the details I have just imparted. Is it not an
oddtale?'
'Just tell me this,* said I,'and since you know so much
you surely can tell it me — what of Mr. Bochester? How
and where is he 7 What is he doing ? Is he well 7'
'I am ignorant of all concerning Mr. Bochester: the
letter never mentions him but to narrate the fraudulent and
illegal attempt I have adverted to. You should rather ask
the name of the governess — the nature of the event which
requires her appearance.'
'Did no one go to Thomfield Hall then 7 Did no one
see Mr. Bochester 7 *
'I suppose not'
* But they wrote to him?'
'Of course.'

JANE BTBB 4£S
'And what did he flay 7 Whohu hia lettora?'
'Sfr. Briggs intimates Uiat the answer to hu applicatioo
was not from Mr. Bocbester, bat from a lady : U is Bigned
" Alice Fairfax. "'
I felt cold and dismayed : my worst fears then were
probably true : he bad in all probabihty left England, and
roshed in reckless desperation to some former haunt on the
Contioent And what opiate (or his severe sntferinga — what
object tor his strong pasaions — had ha sought tha«? I
dared not answer the qaestion. Oh, my poor master-^
once almost my husband — whom I had often called'my
dear Bd ward I'
'He must hare been a bad man,* observed Mr. Birera.
'You don't know him — don't frononncs an opinion npon
him,'I said, with warmth.
'Very well,'he answered, quietly :'and indeed my bead
is otherwise occupied than with him : I have my tale to
finish. Since yon won't ask the governess's name, I must
tell it of my own accord — stay — I have it here — it is alwaym
more satieFactory to see important pmnta written down,
fairly committed to black and white.'
And the pocket-book was again deliberately prodnoed^
opened, sought through ; from one of its oompartments was
extracted a shabby slip of paper, hastily torn off : I recognised
in its texture and ite stains of ultramarine and lake and
vermilion the ravished margin of the portrait-cover. He
got up, held it close to my eyes : and I read, traced in Indian
ink, in my own handwriting, the words'Jane Eyre'— the
work doubtless of some moment of abstraction.
'Briggs wrote to me of a Jane Eyre,'he said ;'the
advertisements demanded a Jane Eyre ; I knew a Jane
Elliott.— I confeBS I had my suspicions, but it was only
yesterday afternoon they were at once resolved into certainty.
You own the name and renounce the aiias t'
'Yes — yes— but where is Mr. Briggs? He perhaps knows
more of Mr. Rochester than yon do.'

thing at all about Mr. Bochester ; it is oot in Mr. Bochester
he i3 interested. Meantime you forget essential points in
pursuing trifles : you do not inquire why Mr. Briggs sought
after you — ^what he wanted with you«*
« Well, what did he want?'
'Merely to tell you that your uncle, Mr. Eyre of Madeira,
is dead ; that he has left you all his property, and that you
are now rich — merely that — ^nothing more.*
•Ilrich?'
* Yes, you, rich — quite an hdress.'
Silence succeeded.
'Tou must prove your identity, of course,* resumed Si
John, presently :'a step which will offer no difficulties : you
can then enter on immediate possession. Your fortune is
vested in the English funds ; Briggs has the will and the
necessary documents.'
Here was a new card turned up I It is a fine thing,
reader, to be lifted in a moment from indigence to wealth —
a very fine thing : but not a matter one can comprehend, or
consequently enjoy, all at once. And then there are other
chances in life far more thrilling and rapture- giving ; this is
solid, an affair of the actual world, nothing ideal about it :
all its associations are solid and sober, and its manifestations
are the same. One does not jump, and spring, and shout
hurrah! at hearing one has got a fortune; one begins to
consider responsibilities and to ponder* business ; on a base
of steady satisfaction rise certain grave cares — and we con-
tain ourselves, and brood over our bliss with a solemn brow.
Besides, the words Legacy, Bequest, go side by side with
the words Death, FuneraL My uncle I had heard was dead —
my only relative ; ever since being made aware of his exist-
ence I had cherished the hope of one day seeing him: now,
I never should. And then this money came only to me : not
to me and a rejoicing family, but to my isolated sell It
was a grand boon doubtless ; and independence would be
glorious — yes. I felt thBi—that thought swelled my heart

'How much am I worth?*
* Oh, a trifle I Nothing of ooiuse to speak of — ^twenlj
thousand pounds, I think they say— but what is thai?'
'Twenty thousand pounds ?'
Here was a new stunner — ^I had been calouIatiDg on four
or five thousand. This news actually took my breath for a
moment: Mr. St John, whom I had never heard lau^
before, laughed now.
'Well,'said he,'if you had oommitied a murder, and I
had told you your crime was disooyered, you could scarcely
look more aghast'*
* It is a large sum—- don't you think there is a mistake?*
'No mistake at alL'
'Perhaps you have read the figures wrong — ^it may be
2,0001'
'It is written in letters, not figures, — twenty thousand.'
I again felt rather like an individual of but average
gastronomical powers sitting down to feast alone at a taUe
spread with provisions for a hundred. Mr. Bivers rose now
and put his doak on.
'If it were not such a very wild night/ he said,'I would
send Hannah down to keep you company: you look too
desperately miserable to be left alone. But Hannah, poor
woman I could not stride the drifts so well as I : her legs are
not quite so long : so I must e'en leave you to your sorrows.
Good-night'
He was lifting the latch : a sudden thought occurred to
me.
'Stop one minute I * I cried.
•WeU?'
'It puzzles me to know why Mr. Briggs wrote to yoa
about me; or how he knew you, or could fancy that yoa«
living in such an out-of-the-way place, had the power to aid

'Oh I I am a clergyman,'he said ; * and the clergy are
often appealed to about odd matters.*
Again the latch rattled.
'No : that does not satisfy me I * I exclaimed : and,
indeed, there was something in tiie hasty and unexplanatory
reply which, instead of allaying, piqued my curiosity more
than ever.
'It is a very strange piece of business,'I added. * I must
know more about it*
'Another time.'
'No: to-night I — to-night I'and as he turned from the
door I placed myself between it and him. He lookedrather
embarrassed.
'You certainly shall not go till you have told me alll'I
saidp
'I would rather not, just now/
'You shall I — you must I'
'I would rather Diana or Mary informed you.'
Of course these objections wrought my eagerness to a
climax : gratified it must be, and that without delay ; and I
told him so.
'But I apprised you that I was a hard man,'said he;
'difficult to persuade.'
'And I am a hard woman,— impossible to put ofE.'
'And then,'he pursued,'I am cold : no fervour infects
me.'
'Whereas I am hot, and fire dissolves ice. The blase
there has thawed all the snow from your cloak ; by the same
token it has streamed on to my floor, and made it Uke a
trampled street As you hope ever to be forgiven, Mr.
Rivers, the high crime and misdemeanour of spoiling a sanded
kitchen, tell me what I wish to know.'
'Well, then,'he said,'I yield ; if not to your earnestness,
to your persevemnce : as stone is worn by continual dropping.
Besides, you must know some day, — as well now as Uter*
Your name is Jane Eyre?'
'Of course : that was all settled before.'

'No, indeed I I remember now seeiiig the letter B

stood. But what then 7 Sniely*— —
I stopped : I conld not trust myself to entertain, mneh
less to express, the thought that rushed upon me — that
embodied itself, — that, in a second, stood out a strong, solid
probability. Circumstances knit themselves, fitted them-
selves, shot into order: the chain that had been lying
hitherto a formless lump of links was drawn out straight, —
every ring was perfect, the connection complete. I knew,
by instinct, how the matter stood before St John had said
another word : but I cannot expect the reader to have the
same intuitive perception, so I must repeat his explanation,
* My mother's name was Eyre ; she had two brothers ;
one a clergyman, who married Miss Jane Beed, of Gates-
head ; the other, John Eyre, Esq., merchant, late of
Funchal, Madeira. Mr. Briggs, being Mr. Eyre's soUdtor,
wrote to us last August to inform us of our uncle's death ;
and to say that he had left his property to his brother the
clergyman's orphan daughter; overlooking us, in conse-
quence of a quarrel, never forgiven, between him and my
father. He wrote again a few weeks since, to intimate that
the heiress was lost ; and asking if we knew anything of her.
A name casually written on a slip of paper has enabled me
to find her out. You know the rest.'Again he was going,
but I set my back against the door.
'Do let me speak,'I said ;'let me have one moment to
draw breath and reflect'I paused — he stood before me, hat
in hand, looking composed enough. I resumed:'Your
mother was my father's sister?'
•Yes.»
'My aunt, consequenUy 7 *
He bowed.

'You three, then, are my cousins ; half oar blood on each
side flows from the same soaroe? *
'We are cousins ; yes.'
i sunreyed him« It seemed I had found a brother: one
I could be proud of» — one I could love; and two sisters
whose qualities were such that, when I knew them but as
mere strangers, they had inspired me with genuine affection
and admiration. The two girls on whom, kneeling down
on the wet ground, and looking through the low, latticed
window of Moor House- kitchen, I had gazed with so
bitter a mixture of interest and despair were my near kins-
women; and the young and stately gentleman who had
found me almost dying at his threshold was my blood
relation. Glorious discovery to a lonely wretch I lliis was
wealth indeed I — wealth to the heart I — a mine of pure,
genial affections. This was a blessing, bright, vivid, and
exhilarating ; — not like the ponderous gift of gold : rich and
welcome enough in its way, but sobering from its weight I
now clapped my hands in sudden joy — my pulse bounded,
my veins thrilled.
'Oh, I am glad I — I am glad I'I exclaimed.
8t John smiled.'Did I not say you neglected essential
points to pursue trifles?'he asked.'You were serious
when I told you you had got a fortune; and now, for a
matter of no moment, you are excited.'
'What can you mean ? It may be of no moment to you ;
you have sisters, and don't care for a cousin ; but I had
nobody ; and now three relations, — or two, if you don't
choose to be counted, — are bom into my world full grown.
I say again, I am glad I'
I walked fast through the room : I stopped, half suffo*
cated with the thoughts that rose faster than I could receive,
comprehend, settle them : — thoughts of what might, could,
would, and should be, and that ere long. I looked at the

Uank wall : it seemed a sky, thick with ^9^M»n^ing 8tai% —
every one lit me to a purpoee or delight. Those who had
saved my life, whom till this hoar I had loved hanenlyv I
could now boiefit They were under a yoke : I oonld free
them : they were scattered,— I ooold reonite them — the
independence, the a£9aence which was mine might be theirs
too. Were we not four? Twenty thousand pounds shared
equally would be five thousand each, enou^ and to spare:
justice would be done, — mutual happiness secured. Now
the wealth did not weigh on me : now it was not a mere
bequest of coin, — it was a legacy of life, hope, enjoyment.
How I looked while these ideas were taking my spirit by
storm I cannot teU ; but I perceived soon that Mr. Bivers
had placed a chair behind me, and was gently attempting to
make me sit down on it He also advised me to be com-
posed : I scorned the insiniuktion of helplessness and
distraction, shook off his hand, and began to walk about
again.
'Write to Diana and Mary to^norrow,'I said,'and tell
them to come home directly; Diana said they would both
consider themselves rich with a thousand pounds, so with
five thousand they will do very welL'
'Tell me where I can get you a glass of water,'
St. John ;'you must really make an effort to tranquil
your feelings.'
'Nonsense I and what sort of an effect will the beqnest
have on you ? Will it keep you in England, induce yon to
marry Miss . Oliver, and settle down Uke an ordinary
mortal?'
*You wander: your head becomes confused. I have
been too abrupt in communicating the news ; it has excited
you beyond your strength.'
'Mr. Bivers I you quite put me out of patience ; I am
rational enough ; it is you who misunderstand ; or rather who
affect to misunderstand.'
'Perhaps if you explained yourself a little more fully I
should comprehend better.'

* Explain I What is there to explain 7 Yon cannot fail
to see that twenty thousand pounds, the sum in question,
divided equally between the nephew and three nieces of our
unde will ^ve five thousand to each? What I want is,
that you should write to your sbters and tell them of the
fortune that has accrued to theoL*
* To you, you mean.'
'I have intimated my view of the case : I am incapable
of taking any other. I am not brutally selfish, blindly
unjust, or fiendishly ungrateful. Besides, I am resolved I
will have a home and connections. I like Moor House, and
I ¥dll live at Moor House ; I like Diana and Mary, and I
will attach myself for life to Diana and Mary. It would
please and b^efit me to have five thousand pounds; it
would torment and oppress me to have twenty thousand;
which, moreover, could never be mine in justice, though it
might in law. I abandon to you, then, what is absolutely
superfluous to me. Let there be no opposition, and no
discussion about it; let us agree amongst each other, and
decide the point at once.'
'This is acting on first impulses ; you must take days to
consider such a matter, ere your word can be regarded as
vaUd.'
'Oh I if all you doubt is my sincerity, I am easy : you see
the justice of the case 7 *
'I (fo see a certain justice ; but it is contrary to all

gained it by his own efibrts ; he was free to leave it to whom
he would : he left it to you. After all, justice permits you
to keep it : you may, with a dear consdence, consider it
absolutely your own.'
'With me/ said I,'it is fuUy as much a matter of feeling
as of consdence : I must indulge my feelings ; I so sddom
have had an opportunity of doing so. Were you to argne,
object, and annoy me for a year, I could not forego the
delidous pleasure of which I have caught a glimpse — that of
repaying, in part, a mighty obligation, and winning to myself
life-long friends.'

It was near Christmas by the time aU was settled: the
season of general holiday approached. I now olosed Morton
school, taking care that the parting should not be barren
on my side. Good fortnne opens the hand as well as the
heart wonderfully ; and to give somewhat when ws liAve
largely received, is but to afford a vent to the nnnsnal
ebullition of the sensations. I had long felt with pleasure
that many of my rustio sbholars liked me. and when we
parted that eonsciousness was confirmed: they m^Tiiff^ted
their affection plainly and strongly. Deep was my gratifioa >
tion to find I had really a place in their unsophisticated
hearts : I promised them that never a week should pass in
future that I did not visit them, and give them an hour's
teaching in their schooL
Mr. Kvers came up, as — ^having seen the classes, now
numbering sixty girls, file out before me, and locked the door
— I stood with the key in my hand, exchanging a few words
of special farewell widi some half-dozen of my best scholars :
as decent, respectable, modest, and well-informed yoong
women as could be found in the ranks of the British
peasantry. And that is saying a great deal; for after all
the British peasantry are the best taught, best mannered,
most self-respecting of any in Europe : since those days I
have seen paysannes and B & uerinnen : and the best of them
seemed to me ignorant, coarse, and besotted, eompared with
my Morton girls.
'Do you consider you have got your reward for a season
of exertion?'asked Mr. Bivers when they were gone.

'Doubtless.'
'And you have only toiled a few months I Would not a
life devoted to the tadc of r^enerating your race be well

'Yes,'I said ;'but I could not go on for ever so : I want
to enjoy my own faculties as well as to cultivate those of
other people. I must enjoy them now ; don't recall either
my mind or body to the school : I am out of it, and disposed
for full holiday.'
He looked grave.'What now? What sudden eager-
ness is this you evince? -What are y6u going to do?'
'To be active : as active as I can. And first I must beg
you to set Hannah at liberty, and get somebody else to wait
on yon.'

what purpose, what ambition in life have you now ?'

trite transient objects. Do you hear, Jane 7'
'Yes ; just as if you were speaking Greek. I feel I have

Happy at Moor House I was, and hard I worked ; and
80 did Hannah : she was charmed to see how jovial I could
be amidst the bustle of a house turned topsy-turvy — ^how I
could brushy and dust, and dean, and cook. And really
after a day or two of confusion worse confounded it was
delightful, by degrees, to invoke order from the chaos
ourselves had made. I had previously taken a journey to
8 to purchase somenew furniture : my < ^usins having
given me carte blanche to effect what alterations I pleased,
and a sum having been set aside for that purpose. The
ordinary sitting-room and bedrooms I left much as they
were: for I knew Diana and Mary would derive more
pleasure from seeing again the old homely tables and chairs
and beds than from the spectacle of the smartest innovations.
Still some novelty was necessary, to give to their return the
piquancy with which I wished it to be invested. Dark
handsome new carpets and curtains, an arrangement of
some carefully selected antique ornaments in porcelain and
bronzei new coverings, and mirrors, and dressing-cases for
the toilet-tables, answered the end: they looked fresh
without being glaring. A spare parlour and bedroom I
refurnished entirely with old mahogany and crimson
upholstery : I laid canvas on the passage and carpets on the
stairs. When all was finished, I thought Moor House as
complete a model of bright modest snugness within as it
was, at this season, a specimen of wintry waste and desert
dreariness without
The eventful Thursday at length came. They were
expected about dark, and ere dusk fires were lit upstairs
and below ; the kitchen was in perfect trim ; Hannah and I
were dressed, and all was in readiness.
St John arrived first I had entreated him tokeepquite

clear of the house till eyerytUng was amnged : and, indeed,
the bare idea of the commotion, at once sordid and trivia^
going on within its walls sufficed to scare him to estrange-
ment. He found me in the kitchen, watching the piogresi
of certain cakes for tea, then baking. Approaching the
hearth, he asked,'If I was at last satisfied with housemaid's
work?'I answered by inviting him to accompany me on a
general inspection of the result of my labours. With some
difficulty I got him to make the tour of the house. He just
looked in at the doors I opened ; and when he had wandered
upstairs and downstairs, he said I must have goue throng a
great deal of fatigue and trouble to have eflTeoted such
considerable changes in so short a time : but not a syUable
did he utter indicating pleasure in the improved aspect of
his abode.
This silence damped me. I thought perhaps the altera-
tions had disturbed some old associations he valued. I
V inquired whether this was the case: no doubt in a
somewhat crestfallen tone.
'Notatall; he had, on the contrary, remarked that I had
scrupulously respected every association : he feared, indeed,
I must have bestowed more thought on the matter than it
was worth. How many minutes, for instance, had I
devoted to studying the arrangement of this very room ?^-
By-the-bye, coidd I tell him where such a book " was ?'
I showed him the volume on the shelf : he took it down,
and withdrawing to his accustomed window recess, ha
began to read it.'
Now, I did not like this, reader. St John was a good
man ; but I began to feel he had spoken truth of himself
when he said he was hard and cold. The humanities and
amenities of life had no attraction for him — its peaceful
enjoyments no charm. Literally, he lived only to aspire —
after what was good and great, certainly ; but still he would
never rest ; nor approve of others resting round him. As I
looked at his lofty forehead, still and pale as a white stone
— at his fine lineaments fixed in study — I comprehended all

at once that he would hardly make a good husband : that it
would be a trying thing to be his wife. I understood, as by
inspiration, the nature of his love for Miss Oliver ; I agreed
with him that it was but a love of the senses. I compre-
hended how he should despise himself for the feverish
influence it exercised over him; how he should wish to
stifle and destroy it; how he should mistrust its ever
conducing permanently to his happiness, or hers. I saw he
VTas of the material from which nature hews her heroes —
Christian and Pagan — ^her lawgivers, her statesmen, her
'conquerors ; a steadfast bulwark for great interests to rest
upon ; buty at the fireside, too often a cold cumbrous column,
gloomy and out of place. .
'This parlour is not his sphere*'I reflected;'the
Himalayan ridge, or CSaffire bush, even the plague-cursed
Guinea Coast swamp, would suit him better. Well may he
eschew the calm of domestic life ; it is not his element :
there his faculties stagnate— they cannot develop or appear
to advantage. It is in scenes of strife and danger — ^where
courage is proved, and energy exercised, and fortitude
tasked — that he will speak and move, the leader and
superior. A merry child would have the advantage of him
on this hearth. He is right to choose a missionary's career
— ^I see it now.'
'They are coming I they are coming I'cried Hannah,
throwing open the parlour door. At the same moment old
Carlo barked joyfully. Out I ran. It was now dark : but a*
rupbling of wheels was audible. Hani^ soon had a
lantern lit. The vehicle had stopped at the wicket; the
driver opened the door: first one well-known form, then
another, stepped out. In a minute I had my face under
their bonnets, in contact first with Mary's soft cheek, then
with Diana's flowing curls. They laughed — kissed me—
then Hannah : patted Carlo, who was half wild with delight,
asked eagerly if all was well ; and being assured in the
afiBrmative, hastened into the house.
They were stiff with their long and jolting drive from

pleasant ooontenanoes expanded to the oheerfnl fire-BgliL
While the driver and Hannah broiig^i in the bozei» they
demanded St. John. At this m oment he advanced from the
parlonr. They both threw their arms round his neck at
once. He gave each one qniet Ues, said in a low tone a few
words of welcome, stood a while to be tallrod to^ and then,
intimating that he supposed they would soon rejoin him in
the parlour, withdrew there as to a place of refuge.
I had lit their candles to go upstairs, but Diana had finl
to give hospitable orders respecting the driver; this doncv
both followed me. They were delighted with the renovation
and decoration of their rooms ; with the new drapery, and
fresh carpets, and rich tinted china vases : they exprnssed
their gratification ungrudgingly. I had the pleasure of feel*
ing ^t my arrangements met their wishes exactly; and
that what I had done added a vivid charm to their joyous
return home.
Sweet was that evening. My coudns, full of exhilaraticn,
were so eloquent in narrative and comment, that their fluency
covered St. John's taciturnity : he was sincerely glad to see
his sisters ; but in their glow of fervour and flow of joy
he could not sympathise. The event of the day — that
is, the return of Diana and Mary — pleased him; but
the accompaniments of ^at event, the glad tumult^ the
garrulous glee of reception, irked him : I saw he wished the
calmer morrow was come. In the very meridian of the
night's enjoyment, about an hour after tea, a rap was heard
at the door. Hannah entered with the intimation that'a
poor lad was come, at that unlikely time, to fetch Mr. Bivera
to see his mother, who was drawing away/

But he was already in the passage, putting on his oloak ;
and without one objection, one murmur, he departed. It
was then nine o'clock: he did not return till midnight*
Starved and tired enough he was: but he looked happier
than when he set out.'He had performed an act of duty ;
made an exertion; felt his own strength to do and deny,
and was on better terms with himseU.
I am afraid the whole of the ensuing week tried his
patience. It was CShristmas week : we took to no settled
employment, but spent it in a sort of merry domestic dissi-
pation. The air of the moors, the freedom of home, the
dawn of prosperity, acted on Diana and Mary's spirits like
some life-giving elixir: they were gay from morning till
noon, and from noon till night. They could always talk;
«nd their discourse, witty, pithy, original, had such charms
for me, that I preferred listening to, and sharing in it, to
doing anything else. St. John did not rebuke our vivacity ;
but he escaped from it : he was seldom in the house ; his
parish was large, the population scattered, and he found
daily business in visitii^ the sick and poor in its different
districts.
One morning, at breakfast, Diana, after looking a little
pensive for some minutes, asked him,'If his plans were yet
unchanged?'
'Unchanged and unchangeable,'was the reply. And he
proceeded to inform us that his departure from England was
now definitively fixed for the ensuing year.
'And Bosamond Oliver ?'suggested Mary : the . words
seeming to escape her lips involuntarily : for no sooner had
she uttered them, than she made a gesture as if wishing to
recall them. St. John had a book in his hand — ^it was his
unsocial custom to read at meals — he closed it, and looked
up.
'Bosamond Oliver,'said he,'is about to be married to

tSr. Granby ; one of tbs best oonnected and most ectimibla

Granby: I had the intelligenoe from her father jettflr-
a.y.-
His fiisten looked at each other, and at in« ; we all thraa
looked at him : he was serene as glass.
'The match mast have been got up hastily,'said Diana:
'they cannot have known each other long:*
■ Bat two months : they met in October at the oomity
ball at B . But where there are no obstacles to a muon,
OS in the present case, where the connection is in erety

as soon as S —'— Place, which Sir Frederic gives up to
them, can be refitted for their reception.*
The first time I found St John alone after this com-
mnnication, I felt tempted to inquire it the event distressed
him : but he seemed so httle to need sympathy, that, so far
from venturing to offer him more, I experienced sonie shame
at the recollection of what I had already hazarded. Besides,
I was out of practice in talking to him : his reserve was aguD
frozen over, and my frankness was congealed beneath it.
He had not kept his promise of treating me like bis sisten ;
he continually made little chilling differences between os,
which did not at all tend to the development of cordiality ;
in short, now that I was acknowledged his kinswoman, and
lived under the same roof vrith him, I felt the distance
between ub to be tar greater than when he had known me
only as the village schoolmistress. When I remembered
how for I had once been admitted to his confidence, I oonld
hardly comprehend his present frigidity.
Such being the case, I felt not a little surprised when he
raised his head suddenly & om the desk over which he was
stooping, and said : —'Yon see, Jane, the battle is fonght
and the victory won.'
Startled at being thus addressed, I did not immediately
reply : after a moment's hesitation I answered : —'But are
you sure you are not in the position of those oooquerors

whose triumphs have cost them too dear ? Would not such
another ruin you ? *
* I think not ; and if I were, it does not much signify;
I shall never be called upon to contend for such another.
The event of the conflict is decisive : my -way is now clear;
I thank God for it I'So saying, he returned to his papers
and his silence.
As our mutual happiness {i.e. Diana's, Mary's, and mine)
settled into a quieter character, and we resumed our usual
habits and regular studies, St. John stayed more at home :
he sat with us in the same room, sometimes for hours
together. While if ary drew, Diana pursued a course of
encydopsBdic reading she had (to my awe and iunazement)
undertaken, and I fagged away at Oerman, he pondered
a mystic lore of his own : that of some Eastern tongue,
the acquisition of which he thought necessary to his
plans.
Thus engaged, he appeared, sitting in his own recess,
quiet and absorbed ienough ; but that blue eye of his had
a habit of leaving the outlandish-looking grammar, and
wandering over, and sometimes* fixing upon us, his fellow
students, with a curious intensity of observation : if caught,
it would be instantly withdrawn ; yet ever and anon it re-
turned searchingly to our table. I wondered what it meant :
I wondered, too, at the punctual satisfaction he never failed
to exhibit on an occasion that seemed to me of small
moment, namely, — my weekly visit to Morton school ; and
still more was I puzzled when, if the day was unfavourable,
if there was snow, or rain, or high wind, and his sisters
urged me not to go, he would invariably make light of their
solicitude, and encourage me to accomplish the task without
regard to ihe elements.
'Jane is not such a weakling as you would make her,'
he would say :'she can bear a mountain blast, or a shower,
or a few flakes of snow, as well as any of us. Her con-
stitution is both sound and elastic ; — better calculated to
endure variations of climate than many more robust.'

I saw that to murmur would be to vex him : on all ooeamont
fortitude pleased him; the reverse was a special annoj-
ance.
One afternoon, however, I got leave to stay at hornet
because I really had a cold. His sisters were gons to
Morton in my stead : I sat reading Schiller ; he, deciphering
his crabbed Oriental scrolls. As I exchanged a translation
for an exercise, I happened to look his way : there I found
myself under the influence of the ever-watchfol Uue eye.
How long it had been searching me tiirough and through,
and over and over, I cannot tell : so keen was it, and yet so
cold, I felt for the moment superstitious — as if I were sitting
in the room with something uncanny.
'Jane, what are you doing?*
* Learning German.'
* I want you to give up G^erman, and leam ffindostanee.*
* You are not in earnest?'
'In such earnest that I must have it so : and I will tell
you why.'
He then went on to explain that Hindostanee was the
language he was himself at present studying : that, as he
advanced, he was apt to forget the commencement ; that it
would assist him greatly to have a pupil with whom he
might again and again go over the elements, and so fix
them thoroughly in his mind ; that his choice had hovered
for some time between me and his sisters ; but that he had
fixed on me, because he saw I could sit at a task the longest
of the three. Would I do him this favour? I should not»
perhaps, have to make the sacrifice long ; as it wanted now
barely three months to his departure.
St. John was not a man to be lightly refused : you felt
that every impression made on him, either for pain or
pleasure, was deep-graved and permanent. I consented.
When Diana and Mary returned, the former found her
scholar transferred from her to her brother: she laughed;

and both she and Mary agreed that St. John should never
have persuaded them to such a step. He answered, quietly :

I found hun a very patient, very forbearing, and yet an
exacting master : he expected me to do a great deal ; and
when I fulfilled his expectations, he, in his own way, fuUy
testified his approbation. By degrees, he acquired a certain
influence over me that took away my libertv of mind : his
praise and notice were more restraining than ids indifference.
I could no longer talk or laugh freely when he was by,
because a tiresomely importunate instinct reminded me that
vivacity (at least in me) was distasteful to him. I was so
fully aware that only serious moods and occupations were
acceptable, that in his presence every effort to sustain or
follow any other became vain : I fell under a freezing spelL
When he said'go,'I went ; * come,'I came ;'do this,'I
did it. But I did not love my servitude : I wished, many a
time, he had continued to neglect me.
One evening when, at bedtime, his sisters and I stood
round him, bidding him good-night, he kissed each of them, as
was his custom ; and, as was equally his custom, he gave
me his hand. Diana, who chanced to be in a frolicsome
humour {she was not painfully controlled by his will ; for
hers, in another way, was as strong), exclaimed: —'St
John I you used to caU Jane your third sister, but you don't
treat her as such : you should kiss her too.'
She pushed me towards him. I thought Diana very
provoking, and felt uncomfortably confused; and while I
was thus thinking and feeling, St. John bent his head ; his
Greek face was brought to a level with mine, his eyes
questioned my eyes piercingly — he kissed me. There are
no such things as marble kisses, or ice kisses, or I should
say my ecclesiastical cousin's salute belonged to one of
these classes ; but there may be experiment kisses, and his
was an experiment kiss. When given, he viewed me to
leam the result ; it was not striking : I am sure I did not
blush ; perhaps I might have turned a little pale, for I felt
mt^f^a^

as if this kiss were a seal aflKxed to my fetten. He nerer
omitted the ceremony afterwards^ and the gravity and
quiescence with which I onderwent it seemed to invesl il
for him with a certain charm.
As for me, I daily wished more to please him : bat to do
so, I felt daily more and more that I must disown half my
nature, stifle half my faculties* wrest my tastes from thdr
original bent, force myself to the adoption of pnxsiiite for
which I had no natursd vocation. He wanted to train me to
an elevation I could never reach ; it racked me hourly to aspiie
to the standard he uplifted. The thing was as impoesiUe
as to mould my irregular features to his correct and classic
pattern, to give to my changeable green oyes the sea-Uue
tint and solemn lustre of his own.
Not his ascendancy alone, however, held me in thrall at
present Of late it had been easy enough for me to look
sad : a cankering evil sat at my heart and drained my hap-
piness at its source — ^the evil of suspense.
Perhaps you think I had forgotten Mr. Boohester,
reader, amidst these changes of place and fortune. Not for
a moment. His idea was still with me ; because it was not
a vapour sunshine could disperse ; nor a sand-traced efBgy
storms could wash away : it was a name graven on a tablet*
fated to last as long as tfie marble it inscribed. The craving
to know what had become of him followed me everywhere ;
when I was at Morton, I re-entered my cottage every even*
ing to think of that : and now at Moor House, I sought my
bedroom each night to brood over it.
In the course of my necessary correspondence with Mr.
Briggs about the will, I had inquired if he knew anything of
Mr. Bochester's present residence and state of health ; but,
as St. John had conjectured, he was quite ignorant of all
concerning him. I then wrote to Mrs. Fairfax, entreating
information on the subject I had calculated with certainty
on this step answering my end : I felt sure it would elicit an
early answer. I was astonished when a fortnight passed
without reply ; but when two months wore away, and day

after day the post arrived and brought nothing for me, I fell
a prey to the keenest anxiety.
I wrote again: there was a chance of my first letter
having missed. Renewed hope followed renewed effort : it
shone like the former for some weeks, then, like it, it faded,
flickered : not a line, not a word reached me. When half a
year wasted in vain expectancy my hope died out : and then
I felt dark indeed.
A fine spring shone round me, which I could not enjoy.
Summer approached ; Diana tried to cheer me : she said I
looked ill, and wished to accompany me to the sea-side. This
St. John opposed ; he said I did not want dissipation, I wanted
employment ; my present life was too purposeless, I required
an aim ; and, I suppose, by way of supplying deficiencies, he
prolonged still furtiier my lessons in Hindostanee, and grew
more urgent in requiring their accomplishment : and I, like
a fool, never thought of resisting him — I could not resist
him.
One day I had come to my studies in lower spirits than
usual ; the ebb was occasioned by a poignantly felt dis-
appointment: Hannah had told me in the morning there
was a letter for me, and when I went down to take it, almost
certain that the long looked-for tidings were vouchsafed me
at last, I found only an unimportant note from Mr. Briggs
on business. The bitter check had wrung from me some
tears ; and now as I sat poring over the crabbed characters
and flourishing tropes of an Indian scribe, my eyes filled
again.
St John caUed me to his side to read ; in attempting to
do this my voice failed me : words were lost in sobs. He
and I were the only occupants of the parlour : Diana was
practising her music in the drawing-room, Mary was garden-
ing — it was a very fine May-day, clear, sunny, and breezy.
My companion expressed no surprise at this emotion, nor
did he question me as to its cause ; he only said : —'We will
wait a few minutes, Jane, till you are more composed.'And
while I smothered the paroxysm with all haste, he sat calm

and patient^leaziing on his desk and loddng like a phjsieian
watdiing with the eye of scienoe an expected and folly-
onderstood crisis in a patient's malady. Haying stifled my
sobs, wiped my eyes, and muttered something about not
being very well that mominf^ I resomed my task, and
socoeeded in completing it. St^ John pot away my bocAs
and his, locked his desk, and said : — * Now, Jane, yoa shall
take a walk ; and with me.*
« I wiU caU Diana and Mary.'
'No. I want only one companion this morning and
that must be yoa: pat on yoor things; go oat by the
kitchen door; take the road towards the head of Marsh
Glen : I will j < Hn yoa in a moment.'
I know no medium : I nerer in my life have known any
medium in my dealings with positive, hard characteis,
antagonistic to my own, between absolute submission and
determined revolt. I have always faithfully observed the
one, up to the very moment of bursting, sometimes with
volcanic vehemence, into the othor ; and as neither present
circumstances warranted, nor my present mood inclined me
to mutiny, I observed careful obedience to St. John's direc-
tions ; and in ten minutes I was treading the wild track of
the glen, side by side with him.
The breeze was from the west: it came over the hill,
sweet with scents of heath and rush ; the sky was of stain-
less blue ; the stream descending the ravine, swelled with
past spring rains, poured along plentiful and dear, catching
golden gleams from the sun, and sapphire tints from the
firmament. As we advanced and left the track, we trod a
soft turf, mossy fine and emerald green, minutely enamelled
with a tiny white flower and spangled with a star-like
yellow blossom : the hills, meantime, shut us quite in ; for
the glen, towards its head, wound to their very core.
'Let us rest here,'said St. John, as we reached the first
stragglers of a battalion of rocks, guarding a sort of pass,
beyond which the beck rushed down a waterfall; and
where, still a little further, the mountain shook off turf and

flower, had only heath for raiment, and crag for gem —
where it exaggerated the wild to the savage, and exchanged
the fresh for the frowning — where it guarded the forlorn
hope of solitude, and a last refuge for silence.
I took a seat : St. John stood near me. He looked up the
pass and down the hollow ; his glance wandered away with
the stream, and returned to traverse the unclouded heaven
which coloured it: he removed his hat, let the breeze stir
his hair and kiss his brow. He seemed in communion with
the genius of the haunt : with his eye he bade farewell to
something.
'And I shall see it again,'he said aloud,'in dreams,
when I sleep by the Ganges : and again, in a more remote
hour — ^when another slumber overcomes me — on the shore
of a darker stream.'
Strange words of a strange love I An austere patriot's
passion for his fatherland I He sat down ; for half an hour
we never spoke ; neither he to me nor I to him : that in-
terval past, he recommenced : —'Jane, I go in six weeks ; I
have taken my berth in an East Indiaman which sails on
the twentieth of June.'
'Gk > d will protect you ; for you have undertaken His
work,'I answexed.
'Yes,'said he,'there is my glory and joy. I am the
servant of an infallible master. I am not going out under
human guidance, subject to the defective laws and erring
control of my feeble fellow-worms : my king, my lawgiver,
my captain, is the All-perfect. It seems strange to me that
all round me do not bum to enlist under the same banner, —
to join in the same enterprise.'
'All have not your powers : and it would be folly for the
feeble to wish to march with the strong.'
'I do not speak to the feeble, or think of them : I address
only such as are worthy of the work, and competent to
accomplish it.'
'Those are few in number, and difficult to discover.'
'You say truly : but when found, it is right to stir them

* And what does your heart say?'demanded St. John.
* My heart is mute, — ^my heart is mute,'I answered,
struck and thrilled.
* Then I must speak for it,* continued the deep, relentless
voice.'Jane, come with me to India : come as my help-
meet and fellow-labourer/

as if I had heard a summons from Heaven — as if a visionary

I appealed to one who, in the discharge of what he
believed his duty, knew neither mercy nor remorse. He
continued : —'God and nature intended you for a missionary's

have given you : you are formed for labour, not for love. A
missionary's wife yon must — shall be. You shall be mine :
I claim you — not for my pleasure, but for my Sovereign's
service.*
* I am not fit for it : I have no vocation,'I said.
He had calculated on these first objections : he was not
irritated by them. Indeed, as he leaned back against the
crag behind him, folded his arms on his chest, and fixed his
countenance, I saw he was prepared for a long and trying
opposition, and had taken in a stock of patience to last him
to its close— resolved, however, that ^t close should be

* Humility, Jane,'sidd he,'is the groundwork of Christian
virtues: you say right that you are not fit for the work.
Who is fit for it? Or who, that ever was truly called,
believed himself worthy of the summons ? I, for instance,
am but dust and ashes. With St. Paul, I acknowledge
myself the chiefest of sinners : but I do not sufiTer this sense
of my personal vileness to daunt me. I know my Leader :
that He is just as well as mighty ; and while He has cho9en
a feeble instrument to perform a great task, He will, from
the boundless stores of His providence, supply the inadequacy
of the means to theend. Think like me, Jane — ^trust like me.
It is the Bock of Ages I ask you to lean on : do not doubt
but it will bear the weight of your human weakness.'

studied missionary labours.'

want: I can set you your task from hour to hour ; stand by
you always ; help you from moment to moment. This I
could do in the beginning: soon (for I know your powers) you
would be as strong and apt as myself, and would not require
my help.'
* But my powers — where are they for this undertsking?
I do not feel them. Nothing speaks or stirs in me while
you talk* I am sensible of no light kindling — no life
quickening — no voice counselling or cheering. Oh, I wish I

there : and if he were, what is, what can that ever be to me?
My business is to*liye without him now : nothing so absurd,
so weak as to drag on from day to day, as if I were waiting
some impossible change in circumstances, which might re-
unite me to him. Of course (as St. John once said) I must
seek another interest in life to replace the one lost: is not
the occupation he now offers me truly the most glorious
man can adopt or God assign ? Is it not, by its noble cares
and sublime results, the one best calculated to fill the void
left by uptom affections and demolished hopes ? I believe
I must say, Yes — and yet I shudder. Alas I If I join St.
John, I abandon half mjrself : if I go to India, I go to pre-
mature death. And how will the interval between leaving
England for India, aad India for the grave, be filled ? Oh,
I. know well I That, too, is very clear to my vision. By
straining to satisfy St. John till my sinews ache, I shall
satisfy him — to the finest central point and farthest outward
drcle of his expectations. If I do go with him — ^if I do make
the sacrifice he urges, I will make it absolutely : I will throw
all on the altar — ^heart, vitals, the entire victim. He will
never love me ; but he shall approve me ; I will show him
energies he has not yet seen, resources he has never suspected.
Yes : I can work as hard as he can ; and with as little
grudging.
'Consent, then, to his demand is possible : but for one
item — one dreadful item. It is — that he asks me to be his
wife, and has no more of a husband's heart for me than that
frowning giant of a rock, down which the stream is foaming
in yonder gorge. He prizes me as a soldier would a good
weapon ; and that is all. Unmarried to him, this'would
never grieve me ; but can I let him complete his calculations
—coolly put into practice his plans — go through the wedding
ceremony ? Can I receive from him the bridal ring, endure
all the forms of love (which I doubt not he would scrupu-
lously observe) and know that the spirit was quite absent ?
Can I bear the consciousness that every endearment he
bestows is a sacrifice made on principle? No: such a

As his ^ster, I might accompany him — not as his wifs: I
will tell him so.'
I looked towards the knoll: there he lay. still as a
prostrate column ; his lace turned to me : his eye beaming
watchful, and keen. He started to his feet^ and approsohed
me.
* I am ready to go to India, if I may go free.*
*Your answer requires a ccHnmentary/ he said;'it is
not dear.'
*You have hitherto been my adopted brother: I, your
adopted sister; let us continue as such: you and I had
better not marry.'
He shook his head. * Adopted fraternity will not do in
this case. If you were my r^ sbter it would be different:
I should take you and seek no wife. But as it is, either our
union must be consecrated and sealed by marriage, or it
cannot exist : practical obstacles oppose tfiemselTes to any
other plan. Do you not see it, Jane ? Gonrider a moment
— ^your strong sense will guide you.'
I did consider: and still my sense, such as it was»
directed me only to the fact that we did not love eaoh other
as man and wife should ; and therefore it inferred we ought
not to marry. I said so.'St. John,'I returned,'I regard
you as a brother — you, me as a sister : so let us continue.'
'We cannot — we cannot,'he answered, with short, sharp
determination :'it would not do. You have said you will
go with me to India : remember — you have said thai.'

'WeU — weU. To the main point — the departure with
me from England, the co-operation with me in my future
labours — ^you do not object. You have already as good as
put your hand to the plough : you are too consistent to
withdraw it. You have but one end to keep in view — how

with eSeoi — ^wiih power — ^the mission of your great Master.
To do so» you most have a coadjutor — not a brother ; that is
a loose tie : but a husband. I, too, do not want a sister ; a
sister might any day be taken from me. I want a wife : the
sole helpmeet I can influence efficiently in life and retain
absolutely till death.*
I shuddered as he spoke : I felt his influence in my
marrow — his hold on my limbs.
'Seek one elsewhere than in me, St. John : seek one
fitted to you.*
'One fitted to my purpose, you mean — ^fitted to my
vocation. Again I tell you it is not the insignificant private
individual — the mere man, with the man's selfish senses — I
wish to mate : it is the missionary.*
'And I will give the missionary my energies — ^it is all he
wants — but not myself : that would be only adding the husk

satisfied with half an oblation ? Will He accept a mutilated

His standard I enlist you. I cannot accept on His behalf a
divided allegiance : it must be entire.*
'Oh I I will give my heart to God,* I said. * Tou do not
want it'
I will not swear, reader, that there was not something of
repressed sarcasm both in the tone in which I uttered this
sentence, and in the feeling that accompanied it. I had
silently feared St. John tiU now, because I had not under-
stood him. He had held me in awe, because he had held
me in doubt. How much of him was saint, how much
mortal, I could not heretofore tell: but revelations were
being made in this conference : the analysis of his nature
was proceeding before my eyes. I tow his fallibilities : I
comprehended them. I understood that, sitting there wheze
I did, on the bank of heath, and with that handsome form
before me, I sat at the feet of a man, erring as I. The veil

fell from his hardness and despotism. HaTing fell in him
the presence of these qualities, I felt lus imperfecstioQ, and
took courage. I was with an equal — one with whom I mif^l
argue — one whom, if I saw good, I mi^t lesbi.
He was silent after I had uttered the last sentenoe, and
I presently risked an upward glance at his oonntenanoe.
His eye, bent on me, expressed at once stem surprise and
keen inquiry.'Is she sarcastic, and sarcastic to me /'it
seemed to say.'What does this dgnify ?*
* Do not let us forget that this is a solemn matter/ lie
said ere long : * one of which we may neither think nor talk
lightly without sin. I trust, Jane, you are in earnest when
you say you will give your heart to Gk > d : it is all I want.
Once wrench your heart from man, and fix it on your Maker,
the advancement of that Maker's spiritual kingdom on earth
will be your chief delight and endeavour ; you will be ready
to do at once whatever furthers that end. You will see whiU
impetus would be given to your efforts and mine by oar
physical and mental union in marriage : the only union that
gives a character of permanent conformity to the destinies
and designs of human beings : and, passing over all minor
caprices — all trivial difficulties and delicacies of feeling — all
scruple about the degree, kind, strength or tenderness < rf
mere personal inclination — ^you will hasten to enter into
that union at once.'
'Shall I ?'I said briefly ; and I looked at his features,
beautiful in their harmony, but strangely formidable in thdr
still severity ; at his brow, commanding but not open ; at his
eyes, bright and deep, and searching, but never soft ; at his
tall, imposing figure ; and fancied myself in idea hi$ wife.
Oh 1 it would never do I As his curate, his comrade, all
would be right: I would cross oceans with him in that
capacity ; toil under eastern suns, in Asian deserts with him
in that office ; admire and emulate his courage and devotion,
and vigour ; accommodate quietiy to his masterhood ; smile
undisturbed at his ineradicable ambition ; discriminate the
Christian from the man : profoundly esteem the onCi and

freely forgive the other. I should suffer often, no doubt,
attadied to him only in this capacity : my body would ba
under rather a stringent yoke, but my heart and mind would
be free. I should still have my unblighted self to turn to :
my natural unenslaved feelings with which to communicate
in moments of loneliness. There would be recesses in my
mind which would be only mine, to which he never came ;
and sentiments growing there fresh and sheltered, which \ is
austerity could never blight, nor his measured warrior-march
trample down : but as his wife — at his side always, and
always restrained, and always checked — forced to keep the
fire of my nature continually low, to compel it to bum
inwardly and never utter a cry, though the imprisoned flame
consumed vital after vital — this would be unendurable.
'Si. John I I exclaimed, when I had got so far in my
meditation.
'Well?'he answered icily.
'I repeat: I freely consent to go with you as your fellow-
missionary ; but not as your wife ; I cannot marry you and
become part of you.'
'A part of me you must become,'he answered steadily ;
'otherwise the whole bargain is void. How can I, a man
not yet thirty, take out with me to India a girl of nineteen,
unless she be married to me ? How can we be for ever
together — sometimes in solitudes, sometimes amidst savage
tribes — and unwed ? *

He had done. Turning from me, he once more

But thb time his feelings were all pent in his heart : I was.
not worthy to hear them uttered. As I walked by his side
homeward, I read well in his iron silence all he felt towards
me : the disappointment of an austere and despotic nature,
which has met resistance where it expected submission —
the disapprobation of a cool, inflexible judgment, which has
detected in another feelings and views in which it has no
power to sympathise : in short, as a man, he would have
wished to coerce me into obedience : it was only as a sincere
Christian he bore so patiently with my perversity, and
allowed so long a space for reflection and repentance.
That night, after he had kissed his sisters, he thought
proper to forget even to shake hands with me ; but left the
room in silence. I — who, though I had no love, had much
friendship for him — was hurt by the marked omission : so
much hurt that tears started to my eyes.
'I see you and St. John have been quarrelling, Jane,'
said Diana,'during your walk on the moor. But go after

He was deeply displeased bj what had ooemred tlial

happy reconcUiation was to be had with him — ^no ohoor

patient and placid ; .and when I asked him if he Corgate

CHAPTBB XXXV
Hb did not leave for Cambridge the next day, as he had
said he would. He deferred his departure a whole week ;
and during that time he made me feel what severe punish-
ment a good yet st^, a conscientious yet implacable man
can inflict on one who has offended him. Without one overt
act of hostility, one upbraiding word, he contrived to impress
me momently with the conviction that I was put beyond
the pale of his favour.
Not that St. John harboured a spirit of unchristian
vindictiveness — ^not that he would have injured a hair of my
head, if it had been fully in his power to do so. Both by
nature and principle he was superior to the mean gratifica-
tion of vengeance : he had forgiven me for saying I scorned
him and his love, but he had not forgotten the words ; and as
long as he and I lived he never would forget them. I saw
by his look, when he turned to me, that they were always
written on the air between me and him ; whenever I spoke,
they sounded in my voice to his ear ; and their echo toned
every answer he gave me.
He did not abstain from conversing with me : he even
called me as usual each morning to join him at his desk ;
and I fear the corrupt man within him had a pleasure
tmimparted to, and unshared by, the puisoChristian, in
evincing with what skill he could, while acting and speaking
apparently just as usual, extract from every deed and every
phrase the spirit of interest and approval which had for-
merly communicated a certain austere charm to his language
and manner. To me, he was in reality become no longer

flesh, but marUe; his eye was a oold, bright^ blue gem;
his tongae, a speaking instrument — nothing more.
AH this was torture to me — ^refined, lingering tortoze. It
kept up a slow fire of indignation, and a trembling trooble
of grief » which harassed and crashed me altogether. I felt
how, if I were his wife, this good man, pfore as the de^
sunless source, could soon kill me: without drawing from
my veins a single drop of Uood, < »r receiving on his own
crystal conscience the faintest stain of crime. ESspedally I
felt this when I made any attempt to proj^tiate hiin. No
ruth met my ruth. He experienced no sufEoring from
estrangement — no yearning after reconciliation ; and thou^
more than once, my fast frdlingtears blistered the page over
which we both bent, they produced no more effect on him
than if his heart had been really a matter of stone or metaL
To his sisters, meantime, he was somewhat kinder than
usual : as if afraid that mere coldness would not suflBciently
convince me how completely I was banished and banned,
he added the force of contrast : and this I am sure he did,
not by malice, but on principle.
The night before he left home, happening to see him
walking in the garden about sunset, and remembering, as I
looked at him, that this man, alienated as he now was, had
once saved my life, and that we were near relations, I was
moved to maJce a last attempt to regain his friendship. I
went out and approached him, as he stood leaning over the
little gate : I spoke to the point at once.
'St. John, I am unhappy, because you are still angry
with me. Let us be friends.*
'I hope we are friends,'was the unmoved reply ; while
he still watched the rising of the moon, which he had been
contemplating as I approached.
'No, St John, we are. not friends as we were. Yon
know that'
'Are we not? That is wrong. For my part, I wish yon
no ill and all good.'
'I believe you, St. John ; for I am sure you are incapable

of wishing any one ill : but, as I am your kinswoman, I
should desire somewhat more of affection than that sort of
general philanthropy you extend to mere strangers/
'Of course,'he said.'Tour wish is reasonable ; and I
am far from regarding you as a stranger/
This, spoken in a cool, tranquil tone, was mortifying and
baflSing enough. Had I attended to the suggestions of
pride and ire, I should immediately have left him : but
something worked within me more strongly than those
feelings could. I deeply venerated my cousin's talent and
principle. His friendship was of yalue to me: to lose it
tried me severely. I would not so soon relinquish the
attempt to reconquer it
* Must we part in this way, St. John ? And when you
go to India, will you leave me so, without a kinder word
than you have yet spoken ?*
He now turned quite from the moon, and faced me.
* When I go to India, Jane, will I leave you ? What I
do you not go to India ?*
'You said I could not, unless I married you/
'And you wiU not marry me? You adhere to that
resolution?'
Header, do you know, as I do, what terror those cold
people can put into the ice of their questions ? How much
of the fall of the avalanche is in their anger? of the breaking
up of the frozen sea in their displeasure ?
'No, St. John, I will not marry you. I adhere to my
resolution.'
The avalanche had shaken and slid a little forward ; but
it did not yet crash down.
* Once more, why this refusal ?'he asked.
* Formerly,'I answered,'because you did not love me ;
now, I reply, because you almost hate me. If I were to
tnBXTj you, you would Idll me. You are killing me now.'
His lips and cheeks turned white — quite white.
* I should kill you — I am killing you t Your words are
such as ought not to be used : violent, unfeminine, and

nntrae. They betray on anfortimate state of mind : tbej
merit severe reproof: they would soem inexonsabla ; M
that it IB the duty of man to toi^ve his fellow, even mitfl
HTanty-aod-seven times.'
I had fiaished the bnnnesi now. Whils earnestly
wishing to erase from his mind the trace of my former
offenoe, I had stunped on that tenaoions enrfiaoe another
and far deeper impression : I had burnt it in.
'Now, yon will indeed bate me,'I said.'It is useless
to attempt to conciliate yon : I see I have made an eteniBl
enemy of yon.'
A fresh wrong did these words infliot : the worse beoaoss
they tonohed on the truth. That bloodless lip qnivered to
a temporary spasm. I knew the steely ire I bad whetted.
I was beirt-wning.
'You utterly misinterpret my words,'I said, at onod
seizing bis hand :'I have no intention to grieve or pain
you— indeed, I have not'
Most bitterly he smiled — most decidedly be withdrew
his hand from mine.'And now you recall your prtKniae,
and vnll not go to India at all, I presume ?'said he, after a
considerable pause.
'Yes I will, as your asustant,'I. answered.
A very long dlence sucoeeded. What straggle there was
in him between Nature and Grace in this interval I can-
not tell ; only singular gleams sdndllated in his eyes, and
strange shadows passed over bis ^ce. He spoke at last
'I before proved to you the absurdity of a dngle woman
of your age proposing to accompany abroad a single man of
mine. I proved it to you in suob terras as, I should have
thought, would have prevented your ever agsjn alluding to
the plan. That you have done so, I regret — for your saka.'
I iotermpted him. Anything like a tangiUe reproach
gave me courage at onoe.'Keep to common sense, St John :
you are verging on nonsense. You pretend to be shocked
by what I have said. Tou are not really shocked ; for, with
your superior mind, you cannot be either so dull or so

conceited as to misunderstand my meaning. I say again,
I will be your curate, if you like, but never your wife.'
Again he turned lividly pale ; but, as before, controlled
bis passion perfectly. He answered emphatically, but
calmly :'A female curate, who is not my wife, would never
suit me. With me, then, it seems, you cannot go : but if
you are sincere in your offer, I will, while in town, speak to
a married misdonary, whose wife needs a coadjutor. Your
own fortune will niake you independent of ihe Society's
aid; and thus you may still be spared the dishonour of
brei^ng your promise, and deserting the band you engaged
to join.*
Now I never had, as the reader knows, either given any
formal promise, or entered into any engagement ; and this
language was all much too hard, and much too despotic for
the occasion. I replied :'There is no dishonour ; no breach
of promise ; no desertion in the case. I am not under the
slightest obligation to go to India : especially with strangers.
With you I would have ventured much ; because I admire,
confide in, and, as a sister, I love you : but I am convinced
that, go when and with whom I would, I should not Uve
long in that climate.'
'Ah I you are afraid of yourself,'he said, curling his lip.
'I am. God did not give me my life to throw away ;
and to do as you wish qif^^uld, I begin to think, be almost
equivalent to committing suicide. Moreover, before I
definitively resolve on quitting England, I will know for
certain whether I cannot be of greater use by remaining in
it than by leaving it.'
'What do you mean ? *
'It would be fruitless to attempt to explain : but there is
a point on which I have long endured painful doubt ; and I
can go nowhere tiU by some means that doubt is remov^'
'I know where your heart turns, and to what it dings.

'Are you going to seek Mr. Bodhestetr ?'

He opened the gate, passed throned it, and strayed away
down the glen. He was soon oat of si^t.
On re-entering the parlour, I found Diana standing at
the window, looking very thoughtful Diana was a ipreat
deal taller than I : she put her hand on my shoulder, and,
stooping, examined my face.
* Jane,'she said, *you are always aptated and pale now.
I am sure there is something the matter. Tell we what
business St. John and you have on hand. I have watched
you this half-hour from the window : you must forgive my
being such a spy, but for a long time I have'& ncied I hardly
know what. St John is a strange being *
She paused — I did not speak : soon she resumed : — * Thai
brother of mine cherishes peculiar views of some scni
respecting you, I am sure : he has long distinguished yoa
by a notice and interest he never showed to any one else —
to what end ? I wish he loved you— does he, Jane?'
I put her cool hand to my hot forehead :'No, Die, not
one whit'
'Then why does he follow you so with his eyes — and get
you so frequently alone with him, and keep you so continu-
ally at his side ? Mary and I had both concluded he wished
you to marry him.'
'He does — he has asked me to be his wife.'
• Diana clapped her hands.'That is just what we hoped
and thought I And you wiU marry him, Jane, won't yoa?
And then he will stay in England.'
'Far from that, Diana ; his sole idea in proposing to ma
is to procure a fitting fellow-labourer in his Indian toils.'

'WhatI He wishes you to go to India?'
* Madness I * she ezoUmed.'You would not live three
months there, I am certain. You never shall go : you have
not consented — ^have you, Jane ?'
* I have refused to marry him *
* And have consequently displeased him ?'she suggested.
* Deeply : he will never forgive me, I fear : yet I offered
to accompany him as his sister/
* It was frantic folly to do so, Jane. Think of the task
you undertook—- one of incessant fatigue : where fatigue kilU
even the strong ; and you are weak. St. John — you know
him — would urge you to impossibilities: with him there
would be no permission to rest during the hot hours ; and
unfortunately, I have noticed, whatever he exacts, you force
yourself to perform. I am astonished you found courage to
refuse his hand. You do not love him then, Jane ?'
* Not as a husband.*
* Yet he is a handsome fellow/
'And I am so plain you see, Die. We should never
suit*
'Plain I You ? Not at alL You are much too pretty,
as well as too good, to be grilled alive in Calcutta/ And
again she earnestly conjured me to give up all thoughts of
going out with her brother.
'I must, indeed,'I said ; * for when just now I repeated
the offer of serving him for a deacon, he expressed himself
shocked at my want of decency. He seemed to think I had
committed an impropriety in proposing to accompany him
unmarried : as if I had not from the first hoped to find in
him a brother ; and habitually regarded him as such.'
'What makes you say he does not love you, Jane? ^
'You should hear himself on the subject. He has agam
and again explained that it is not himself, but his office he
wishes to mate. He has told me I am formed for labour-
not for love : which is true, no doubt. But, in my opinion,
if I am not formed for love, it follows that I am not formed

'And then,'I continued,'though I h»Te only avterif
affection for him now, yet, if forced to be his Kife, I eu
ima^ne the poBubility of conoeiiing an inovitaUK atnoga^
tortoring kind of love for him : beoanse he b M trie n ted;
and there is often a certain beroia grandeur in Bia loo^

become unspeakably wretched. He would not want ma to
love *''"'; and if I showed & e feeling he would make ma
senaible that it was a superfluity, onreqnired by bim,
nnbecoming in me. I know he would.*
'And yet St. John is a good man,'said Dian^
'He is a good and a great man : bat he forgets, pitilasaly,
the feelings and claims of little people, in porsoing his own
lai^ views. It is better, therefore, for the inaignifieant to
keep oat of his way ; lest, in bis progress, he should trample
them down. Here he oomesi I vrill leave yon, Diana.'
And I hastened upstturs, as I saw him entering the garden.
But I was forced to meet him agun at supper. During
that meal he appeared just as composed as usuaL I had
thought be would hardly speak to me, and I was certain he
bad given up the pursuit of his matrimonial scheme : the
sequel showed I was mistaken on both points. He addressed
me precisely in his ordinary manner ; or what bad. ol late,
been his ordinary manner; one scrupulously polite. No
doubt be had invoked the help of the Holy Spirit to subdoa
the anger I had roused in him, and now believed he h*d
forgiven me once more.
For the eveniog reading before prayers, be selected the
twenty-first chapter of Bevelation. It was at all times
pleasant to b'steu while from his lipe feU the word* of the

more thrilling meaning — as he sat hi the midst of his
household circle (the May moon shining in through the
uncurtained window, and rendering aknost unnecessary the
light of the candle on the table) : as he sat there, bending
over the great old Bible, and described from its page the
vision of the new heaven and the new earth — told how Ood
would come to dwell with men, how He would wipe away
all tears from their eyes, and promised that there should Ve
no more death, neiUier sorrow nor crying, nor any more
pain, because the former things were paraed away.
The succeeding words thrilled me strangely as he spoke
them : especially as I felt, by the slight, indescribable altera-
tion in sound, that in uttering them, his eye had turned on
'He that overoometh shall inherit all things ; and I will
be his Ood, and he shall be my son. But,'was slowly,
distinctly reftd,'the fearful, the unbelieving, Ac. shall have
their part in the lake which bumeth with fire and brimstone,
which is the second death.'
Henceforward I knew what fate St John feared for
me.
A calm, subdued triumph, blent with a longing earnest-
ness, marked his enunciation of the last glorious verses of
that chapter. The reader believed his name was already
written in the Lamb's book of Ufe, and he yearned after the
hour which should admit him to the city to which the kings
of the earth bring their glory and honour ; which has no
need of sun or moon to shine in it, because the glory of Ood
lightens it, and the Lamb is the light thereoL
In the prayer following the chapter, all his energy
gathered — all Us stem'seal woke : he was in deep earnest,
wrestling with Ood, and resolved on a conquest He sup-
plicated strength for the weak-hearted ; guidance tor wan-
derers from the fold : a return, even at the eleventh hour,
for those whom the temptations of the world and the flesh
were luring from the narrow path. He asked, he urged, be
claimed the boon of a brand snatched from the burning.

whispered hint from him : I tendered my hand, and wished
him a pleasant journey.
'Thank you, Jane. As I said, I shall return firom
Cambridge in afortnight : that space, then, is yet left you for
reflection. If I listened to human pride, I should say no
more to you of marriage with me ; but I listen to my duty,
and keep steadily in view my first aim — ^to do all things to
the glory of Ood. My Master was long-sufiFering : so will I
be. I cannot give you up to perdition as a vessel of vrrath:

Dives, who had his good things in this life. God fpve you

from you I'
He laid his hand on my head as he uttered the last
words. He had spoken earnestly, mildly : his look was not,
indeed, that of a lover beholding his mistress ; but it was
that of a pastor recalling his wandering sheep — or better, of
a guardian angel watching the soul for which he is respon-
sible. All men of talent, whether they be men of feeling
or not ; whether they be zealots, or aspirants, or despota —
provided only they be sincere — ^have their sublime moments :
when they subdue and rule. I felt veneration for St. John
— veneration so strong that its impetus thrust me at ooom to
the point'I had so long shunned. I was tempted to oease
struggling with him — to rush down the torrent of his will
into the gulf of his existence, and there lose my own. I
was almost as hard beset by him now as I had been onoe

before, in a dififerent way, by another. I was a fool both
times. To have yielded then would have been an error of
principle ; to have yielded now would have been an error of
judgment. So I think at this hour, when I look back to
the crisis through the quiet medium of time: I was un-
conscious of folly at the instant.
I stood motionless under my hierophant's touch. My
refusals were forgotten — my fears overcome — my wrestlings
paralysed. The impossible— i.«. my marriage with St. John —
was bhst becoming the Possible. All was changing utterly,
with a sudden sweep. Religion called — Angels beckoned —
God conmianded — life rolled together like a scroll — death's
gates opening, showed eternity beyond : it seemed, that for
safety and bliss there, all here might be sacrificed in a
second. The dim room was full of visions.
'Gould you decide now ?'asked the missionary. The
inquiry was put in gentle tones: he drew me to him as
gently. Oh, that gentleness I how far more potent is it than
force I I could resist St. John's wrath : I grew pliant as a
reed under his kindness. Yet I knew all the time, if I
yielded now, I should not the less be made to repent, some
day, of my former rebellion. His nature was not changed
by one hour of solemn prayer : it was only elevated.
'I could decide if I were but certain,'I answered :'were
I but convinced that it is God's will I should marry you, I
could vow to marry you here and now — come afterwards
what would I *
'My prayers are heard I'ejaculated St John. He
pressed his hand firmer on my head, as if he claimed me :
he surrounded me with his arm, almost as if he loved me (I
say aimast — I knew the difference — for I had felt what it
was to be loved ; but, like him, I had now put love out of
the question, and thought only of duty) : I contended with
my inward dimness of vision, before which clouds yet rolled.
I sincerely, deeply, fervently longed to do what was right ;
and only that.'Show me, show me the path 1'I entreated
of Heaven. I was excited more than I had ever been ; and

All the house was still ; for I believe all. exoept Bt. Jalm

an inexpressible feeling that thrilled it through, and pnwnd

like an electric shook ; but it was qahe as sharp, as atrango;
as startling : it acted on my senses as if their ntmost
activity hitherto had been bat torpor ; from which they were
now sumnoned, and forced to wake. They rose expectant:
eye and ear waited, while the flesh qoiveted on my bones.

St. John. I saw nothing : bnt I heard a vtnoe somewhazo

I might have said,'Where is it?'for it did not seem in

overhead. I had heard it — where, or whenoe, for ever im-
possible to know I And it was the voioa of a hnman bdng

Ify powers were in play, and in force. I told him to forbear
question or remark ; I desired him to leave me : I must,
and would be alone. He obeyed at once. Where there is
energy to command well enough, obedience never fails. I
mounted to my chamber; locked myself in; fell on my
knees; and prayed in my way — a different way to St. |
John's, but effective in its own fashion. I seemed to pene-
trate very near a Mighty Spirit ; and my soul rushed out
in gratitude at His feet. I rose from the thanksgiving — ^took
a resolve — and lay down^ unscaredi enlightened — eager but
for the daylight

Thb daylight oame. I rose at dawn. I busied myself for
an hour or two with arranging my things in my chamber*
drawers, and wardrobe, in the order wherein I should wish
to leaTB ihem during a brief absence. Heantincia, I heard
St. John quit his room. He stopped at my door : I feared
he would knock — ^no, but a slip of paper was paooed uider
the door. I took it up. It bore these words —
'YoQ left me too suddenly last night Had yoa stayed
but a litde longer, you would have laid your hand od the
Christian's cross and the angel's crown. I shall expect
your clear decision when I return this day fortnight.
Meantime, watch and pray that you enter not into tempta*
tion : the spirit, I trust, is willing, but the flesh, I see, is
weak. I shall pray for you hourly, — Tours, St. John.'
'My spirit,'I answered mentally,'is willing to do what
is right ; and my flesh, I hope, is 8tox > ng enough to
plish the will of Heaven, when once that will is
known to me. At any rate, it shall be strong enoog^ to
search — inquire — ^to grope an outlet from this dood at
doubt, and find the open day of certainty.'
It was the first of June ; yet the morning was overcast
and chilly: rain beat fast on my casement. I heard the
front-door open, and St. John pass out. Looking through
the window, I saw him traverse the garden. He took the
way over the misty moors in the direction of Whiterosa —
there he would meet the coach.
'In a few more hours I shall succeed you in thai trabk,
cousin,'thought I :'I too have a coach to meet at

oross. I too have soma to see and ask after in England,
before I depart for ever/
'It wanted yet two hours of breakfast-time. I filled the
interval in walking softly about my room, and pondering
the visitation which had given my plans their present bent.
I recalled that inward sensation I had experienced: for I
could recall it, with all its unspeakable strangeness. I
recalled the voice I had heard ; again I questioned whence
it came, as vainly as before : it seemed in me — ^not in the
external world. I asked, was it a mere nervous impression
— a delusion ? I could not conceive or believe : it was more
like an inspiration. . The wondrous shock of feeling had
come like the earthquake which shook the foundations of
Paul and Silas's prison: it had opened the doors of the
soul's cell, and loosed its bands — ^it had wakened it out of
its sleep, whence it sprang trembling, listening, aghast ; then
vibrated thrice a cry on my startled ear, and in my quaking
heart, and through my spirit ; which neither fearad nor
shook, but exulted as if in joy over the success of one effort
it had been privileged to make, independent of the cumbrous
body.
'Ere many days,'I said, as I terminated my musings,'I
wiU know something of him whose voice seemed last night
to summon me. Letters have proved of no avail — ^personal
inquiry shall replace them.'
At breakfast I announced to Diana and Mary that I was
going a joturney, and should be absent at least four days.
'Alone, Jane ?'they asked.
'Yes; it was to see, or hear news of, a friend about
whom I had for some time been uneasy.'
They m.ght have said, as I have np doubt they thought,
that they had believed me to be without any friends save
them : for, indeed, I had often said so ; but with their true
natural delicacy, they abstained from comment : except that
Diana asked me if I was sure I was well enough to travel I
looked very pale, she observed. I replied, that nothing ailed
me save anxiety of mind, which I hoped soon to alleviate.

It was easy to make my farther airangemenls; far I
was troubled with no inquiries — no snmiises. Having ones
explained to them that I ooold not now be ezj^ioit tbonl
my plans, they kindly and wisely acquiesced in the silenes
with which I porsoed them ; according to ma the priTilegs
of free action I should, muler similar oiroainataiices^ ha^e
accorded them.
I left Moor House at three o'clock p jc, and soon after
four I stood at the foot of the sign-poet of Wbiterosi^
waiting the arrival of the coach which was to take me to
distant Thomfield. Amidst the silence of those sditary
roads and desert hills, I heard it approach troai a great
distance. It was the same vehicle whence, a year agOb I
had alighted one summer evening on this very spot — ^bow
desolate, and hopeless, and objectless! It stopped as I
beckoned. I entered — not now obliged to part with my
whole fortune as the price of its accommodation. Once
more on the road to Thomfield, I felt like the messenger-
pigeon flying home.
It was a journey of nx-and-thirty hours. I had set out
from Whitcross on a Tuesday afternoon, and early on the
succeeding Thursday morning the coach stopped to water
the horses at a wayside inn, situated in the midst of scenery
whose green hedges and large fields and low pastoral hills
(how mild of feature and verdant of hue compared with the
stem north-midland moors of Morton 1) met my eye like
the lineaments of a once familiar & ce. Yes, I knew the
character of this landscape : I was sure we were near my
bourne.
'How far is Thomfield Hall from here?'I asked of the
ostler.
'Just two miles, ma'am, across the fields.*
'My joumey is dosed,'I thought to myself. I got out
of the coach, gave a box I had into the ostler's charge, to be
kept till I called for it ; paid my fare ; satisfied the coach-
man, and was going : the brightening day gleamed on the
dgn of the inn, and I read in gilt letters,'The Booheeter

Arms.* My heart leapt up : I was already on my master's
very lands. It fell again : the thought stmck it : —
'Tour master himself may be beyond the British Channel,
for aught you know : and then, if he is at Thomfield Hall,
towards which you hasten, who besides him is there? His
lunatic wife: and you have nothing to do with him: you
dare not speak to him or seek his presence. You have lost
your labour — ^you had better go no farther,'urged the
monitor.'Ask information of the people at the inn ; they
can give you all you seek : they can solve your doubts at
once. GU > up to that man, and inquire if Mr. Bochester be
at home.'
The suggestion was sensible ; and yet I could not force
myself to act on it. I so dreaded a reply that would crush
me with despair. To prolong doubt was to prolong hope.
I might yet once more see the Hall under the ray of her
star. There was the stile before me — the very fields through
which I had hurried, blind, deaf, distracted, with a revenge-
ful fury tracking and scourging me, on the morning I fled
from Thomfield: ere I well knew what course I had re-
solved to take, I was in the midst of them. How fast I
walked I How I ran sometimes 1 How I looked forward to
catch the first view of the well-known woods I With what
feelings I welcomed single trees I knew, and familiar
glimpses of meadow and hill between them I
At last the woods rose; the rookery clustered dark;
a loud cawing broke the morning stillness. Strange delight
inspired me : on I hastened. Another field crossed — a lane
threaded — and there were the courtyard walls — ^the back
offices: the house itself, the rookery still hid.'My first
view of it shall be in front,'I determined,'where its bold
battlements will strike the eye nobly at once, and where I
can single out my master's very window : perhaps he will
be standing at it — he rises early : perhape he is now walking
in the orchard, or on the pavement in front Gould I but
see him I — but a moment ! Surely, in that case, I should
not be so mad as to run to him? I cannot tell — I am nol

and cries, and gazes, because he no longer fears to waken by
any sound he can utter — by any movement he can make.
He thought his love slept sweetly : he finds she is stone-
dead.
I looked with timorous joy towards a stately house : I
saw a blackened ruin.
No need to cower behind a gate-post, indeed I — to peep
up at chamber lattices, fearing life was astir behind them I
No need to listen for doors opening — to fancy steps on the
pavement or the gravel-walk I The lawn, the grounds were
trodden and waste: the portal yawned void. The front
was, as I had once seen it in a dream, but a shell-like
wall, very high and very fragile looking, perforated with
paneless windows : no roof, no battlements, no chimneys —
all had crashed in.
And there was the silence of death about it : the solitude
of a lonesome wild. No wonder that letters addressed to
people here had never received an answer: as well
despatch epistles to a vault in a church aisle. The grim
blackness of the stones told by what fate the Hall had
fallen — by conflagration: but how kindled? What story
belonged to this disaster ? What loss, besides mortar and
marble and wood- work, had followed upon it? Had life
been wrecked, as well as property? If so, whose? Dread*
ful question : there was no one here to answer it — not even
dimib sign, mute token.
In wandering round the shattered walls and through the
devastated interior, I gathered evidence that the calamity
was not of late occurrence. Winter snows, I thought, had
drifted through that void arch; winter rains beaten in at
* those hollow casements ; for, amidst the drenched piles of
rubbish, spring had cherished vegetation : grass and weed
grew here and there between the stones and fallen rafters.
And oh I where, meantime, was the hapless owner of
this wreck? In what land? Under what auspices?
My eye involuntarily wandered to the grey diuroh
tower near the gates, and I asked,'Is he with Damar

house?*
Some answer mnst be had to these qnestuma. I oonld
find it nowhere but at the inn, and thither, ere lonf^ I
returned. The host himself brought my breakfast into the
parlour. I requested him to shut the door and si down:
I had some questions to ask him. Bat when he complied,
I scarcely knew how to begin; such honor had I cl the
possible answers. And yet ttie spectacle of desolalioD I had
just left prepared me in a measure for a tale of misery/
The host was a respectable-looking, middle-aged man.
'You know Thomfield Hall, of course ?'I managed to
say at last
'Yes, ma*am ; I lived there once.'
'Did you?'Not in my time, I thought: yon are a
stranger to me.
* I was the late Mr. Bochester^s butler,* he added.
The late I I seemed to have received with full foioe the
blow I had been trying to evade.
'Thelatel'Igasped.'Ishedead?'
'I mean the present gentleman, Mr. Edward's father,*
he explained.
I breathed again: my blood resumed its flow. Fully
assured by these words that Mr. Edward — my Mr. Bochester
(Gtod bless him, wherever he was 1) — ^was at least alive : was,
in short,'the present gentleman.'Gladdening words I It
seemed I could hear all that was to come — ^whatever the
disclosures might be — with comparative tranquillity. Since
he was not in the grave, I could bear, I thought, to learn
that he was at the Antipodes.
'Is Mr. Bochester living at Thomfield HaD now?* I
asked, knowing, of course, what the answer would be, bat
yet desirous of deferring the direct question as to where he
really was.
'No, ma'am — oh, not No one is living theie. I

to a deal of them nurses and matrons— ske kept aprhaU

much. It is excusable, for she had a hard life of it : but
still it was dangerous ; for when Mrs. Poole was fast asleep,
after the gin-and-water, the mad lady, who was as canning
as a witch, would take the keys out of her pockety let her-
self out of her chamber, and go roaming about the house,
doing any wild mischief that came into her head, ^ley say
she had nearly burnt her husband in his bed onoe : bat'I
don't know about that. However, on this night, she set fire
first to the hangings of the room next her own ; and then she
got down to a lower story, and made her way to the chamber
that had been the governess's — (she was like as if she knew
somehow how matters had gone on, and had a spite at her)
— and she kindled the bed there; but there VTas nobody

months before ; and for all Mr. Bochester sou^^t her as if
she had been the most precious thing he had in the worid,
he never could hear a word of her ; and he grew savage —
quite savage on his disappointment : he never was a wild
man, but he got dangerous after he lost her. He would be
alone, too. He sent Mrs. Fairfax, the housekeeper, away to
her firiends at a distance ; but he did it handsomely, for be

he had ; for a more spirited, bolder, keener gentleman than
he was before that midge of a governess crossed him, you
never saw, ma'am. He was not a man given to wine, or
cards, or racing, as some are, and he was not so very huid-

The manor-house of Ferndean was a building of oonaidenUi
antiquity, moderate nze, and no arohiteotoral pretenricwi^
deep bnried in a wood. I had heard of it befoiB. Mr.
Bochester often spoke of it, and sometimes went there. His
father had purchased the estate for the sake of the game
covers. He would have let the hooee ; bat could find no
tenant, in consequence of its ineli^Ue and insalobrions sita
Bemdean then remained uninhabited and unfomished ; with
the exception of some two or three rooms fitted op for the
accommodation of the squire when he went thm in the
season to shoot
To ibis house I came, just ere dark, on an evening
marked by the characteristics of sad sky, cold gale, and
continued smaU, penetrating rain. The last mile I performed
on foot, having dismissed the chaise and driver with the
double remuneration I had promised. Even when within a
very short distance of the manor-house you could see
nothing of it; so thick and dark grew the timber ol the
gloomy wood about it Iron gates between granite pillarB
showed me where to enter, and passing through them, I
found myself at once in the twilight of dose-ranked trees.
There was a grass-grown track descending the forest aisle,
between hoar and knotty shafts and under branched arches.
I followed it, expecting soon to reach the dwelling ; but it
stretched on and on, it wound far and farther : no sign of
habitation or grounds was visible.
I thought I had taken a wrong direction and lost my
way. The darkness of natural as well as of sylvan dusk
gathered over me. I looked round in search of another

roftd. There was none : all was interwoven stem, columnar
trunk, dense, summer foliage—no opening anywhere.
I proceeded : at last my way opened, the trees thinned a
little ; presently I beheld a railing, then the house — scarce,
by this dim light, distinguishable from the trees ; so dank
and green were its decaying walls. Entering a portal,
fastened only by a latch, I stood amidst a space of enclosed
ground, from which the wood swept away in a semicircle.
There were no flowers, no garden-beds ; oidy a broad gravel-
walk girdling a grass-plat, and this set in the heavy frame
of the forest. The house presented two pointed gables in
its front ; the windows were latticed and narrow ; the front
door was narrow tod, one step led up to it The whole
looked, as the host of the Bochester Arms had said,'quite a
desolate spot.'It was as still as a church on a week-day :
the pattering rain on the forest leaves was the only sound
audible in its vicinage.
< Oan there be life here?'I asked.
Yes : life of some kind there was : for I heard a move-
ment — that narrow front door was unclosing, and some
shape was about to issue from the grange.
It opened slowly : a figure came out into the twilight and
stood on the step ; a man without a hat : he stretched forth
his hand as if to feel whether it rained. Dusk as it was, I
had recognised him — it was my master, Bdward Eairfaz
Bochester, and no other.
I stayed my step, almost my breath, ani stood to watch
him — to examine him, myself unseen, and alas I to him
invisible. It was a sudden meeting, and one in which
rapture was kept well in check by pain. I had no difficulty
in restraining my voice from exclamation, my step fn»n
hasty advance.
'His form was of the same strong and stalwart contour as
ever : his port was still erect, his hair was still raven-Uaok ;
nor were his features altered or sunk: not in one year's
space, by any sorrow, could his athletic strength be quelled,

He descended the one step, and advanced slowly and
gropingly towards the grass-plat Where was his daring
stride now ? Then he paused, as if he knew not which way
to torn. He lifted his hand and opened hb eyelids ; gaaed
blank, and with a straining efibrti on the sky, and towards
the amphitheatre of trees : one saw that all to him was void
darkness. He stretched his ri^t hand (the left arm, the
mutilated one, he kept hidden in his bosom) ; he seemed to
wish by touch to gain an idea of what lay around him : he
met but vacancy still; for the trees were some jrards off
where he stood. He relinquished the endeavour, folded his
arms, and stood quiet and mute in the rain, now falling fast
on his uncovered head. At this moment John approached
him from some quarter.
'Will you take my arm, sir ?'he said ;'there is a heavy
shower coming on : had you not better go in ?'
* Let me alone,'was the answer.
John withdrew, vdthout having observed me. ICr.
Bochester now tried to walk about: vainly, — all was too
uncertain. He groped his way back to the house, and, re-
entering it, closed the door.
I now drew near and knocked : John's wife opened for
me.'Mary,'I said,'how are you?'
She started as if she had seen a ghost : I calmed her.
To her hurried'Is it really you, miss, come at this late hour
to this'only place ?'I answered by taking her hand ; and
then I followed her into the kitchen, where John now sat by

a good fire. I explained to them, in few words, that I had
heard all which had happened since I left Thomfield, and
that I was come to see Mr. Bochester. I asked John to go
down to the tompike-honse, where I had dismissed the
chaise, and bring my tronk, which I had left there : and
" - then, while I removed my bonnet and shawl, I questioned
Mary as to whether I could be accommodated at tiie Manor
House for the night ; and finding that arrangements to that
efiEect, though difficult, would not be impossible, I informed
her I should stay. Just at this moment the parlour-bell
rang.
'When you go in,* said I,'tell your master that a person
wishes to speak to him, but do not give my name.*
'I don't think he will see you,'die answered;'he refuses
everybody/
When she returned I inquired what he had said.
* You are to send in your name and your business,* she
replied. She then proceeded to fill a glass with water, and
place it on a tray, together with ca ndl es.
'Is that what he rang for ?'I asked.
'Yes : he always has candles brought in at dark, though
he is blind.*
'Give the tray to me ^ I will carry it in.^
I took it from her hand : she pointed me out the parlour
door. The tray shook as I held it ; the water spilt from the
glass ; my heart struck my ribs loud and fast. Mary opened
the door for me, ani shut it behind me.
This parlour looked gloomy : a neglected handful of fire
burnt low in the grate ; and, leaning over it, vnth his head
supported agunst the high, old-fashioned mantelpiece,
appeared the blind tenant of the room. His old dog. Pilot,
lay on one side, removed out of the way, and coiled up "
as if afraid of being inadvertently trodden upon. Pilot
pricked up his ears when I came in : then he jumped up with,
a yelp and a whine, and bounded towards me : he almost
knocked the tray from my hands. I set it on the table ; then
patted him, and said softly,'lie down I'Mr. Bochester

its way to his lips, and seemed to listen : he drank, and pot
the ^ass down.'Thisisyoo, Mary, isii no47'
'Mary is in the kitchen,'I answered.
He put out his hand with a quick gesture, hot not seeing
where I stood, he did not touch me.'Who is this? Who
is this?'he demanded, trying, as it seemed, to eee with those
aghtlesseyes — unavailing and distresong attempt I'Answer
me — speak again I'he ordered, imperiously and akmd.
'Will you have a little more water, sir? I spilt half d

'TFJboisit? TFko^isit? Who speaks?*
'Pilot knows me, and John and Mary know I am here.
I came only tins evening,'I answered.
'Great God I — what delusion has come over me? What
sweet madness has seised me ?'
'No delusion — ^no madness : your mind, sir, is too strong
for delusion, your health too sound for frensy.'
'And where is the speaker? Is it only a voice? Oh I I
cannot see, but I must feel, or my heart will stop and my
brain burst. Whatever — whoever you are — be peroeptiblie

He groped ; I arrested his wandering hand, and prisoned
it in both mine.
'Her very fingers I'he cried ;'her small, slight fingers I
If so, there must be more ot her.'
The muscular hand broke from my custody; my arm
was seized, my shoulder — neck — waist — ^I was entwined and
gathered to him.
'Is it Jane? WhaiiBii? This is her shape— this is her
ease *

'And this her voice,'I added. * She is all here : her
heart, too. Gk > d bless you, sir I I am glad to be so near you
again.'*
'Jane Eyre I — Jane Eyre I'was all he said.
* My dear master,'I answered, * I am Jane Eyre : I have
found you out — I am come back to you.'
'In truth? — in the flesh ? • My living Jane?'
'You touch me, sir, — you hold me, and faist enough ; I
am not cold like a corpse, nor vacant like air, am I?'
• My living darling I These are certainly her limbs, and
these ber features ; but I cannot be so blest, after all my
misery. It is a dream; such dreams as I have had at
night when I have clasped her once more to my heart, as I
do now ; ani kissed her, as thus — and felt that she loved
me, and trusted that she would not leave me.'
'Which I never will, sir, from this day.'
'Never will, says the vision? But I always woke and
found it an empty mockery; and I was desolate and
abandoned — ^my Ufe dark, lonely, hopeless — my soul athirst
and forbidden to drink — my heurt famished Mid never to be
fed. Gentle, soft dream, nestling in my arms now, you will
fly, too, as your sisters have all fled before you : but kiss me
before you ago— embrace me, Jane.'

eyes — I swept his hair from his brow, and kissed that toa
He suddenly seemed to arouse himself : the conviction of
the reality of all this seized him.
'It is you—is it Jane? You are come back to me then?'*
« I am.'
* And you do not Ue dead in some ditch under some
stream? And you are not a pining outcast amongst
strangers?'
* No, sir ; I am an independent woman now.'

'Quite rich, sir. If you wonH let me live with yon, lean

'But as you are rich, Jane, you have now, no doable

yourself to a blind lameter like me ?'
'I told you I am independent^ sir, as well as rich : I am
my own mistress.*
* And you will stay vdih me ?'
'Certainly — ^unless you object. I will be yonr neighbour,
your nurse, your housekeeper. I find you lonely : I will be
your companion — ^to read to you, to walk with yoo, to sit
with you, to wait on you, to be eyes and hands to yon.
Cease to look so melancholy, my dear master ; you shall no4
be left desolate, so long as I live.'
He replied not: he seemed serious — sbstraoted; he
sighed; he half -opened his lips as if to speak: he dosed
them again. I felt a Utile embarrassed. Perhaps I haA too
rashly overleaped conventionalities ; and he, like St. John,
saw impropriety in my inconsiderateness. I had indeed
made my proposal from the idea that he wished and would
ask me to be his wife : an expectation, not the less certain
because unexpressed, had buoyed me up, that he would
claim me at once as his own. But no hint to that effect
escaping him, and his countenance becoming more overcast^
I suddenly remembered that I might have been all wrongs
and was perhaps playing the fool unwittingly ; and I began
gently to withdraw myself from his arms — but he eagerly
snatched me doser.

■weetness of your consolatioQ : I cannot give ap these joys.
I have little left in myself — ^I must have yon. The world
may laugh — may call me absurd, selfish — ^but it does not
signify. My very soul demands you : it will be satisfied : or
it will take deadly vengeance on its frame.'
'Well, sir, I will stay vdth you : I have said so.'
'Yes — ^but you understand one thing by staying with me ;
and I understand another. You, perhaps, could make up
your mind to be about my hand and chair — to wait on me
as a kind little nurse (for you have an affectionate heart and
a generous spirit, which prompt you to make sacrifices for
those you pity), and that ought to suffice for me no doubt.
I suppose I should now entertain none but fatherly feelings
for you : do you think so ? Come — tell me.'
'I will think what you like, sir : I am content to be only
your nurse, if you think it better.'
'But you cannot always be my nurse, J^iet : you are
young — ^you must marry one day.'
'I don't care about being married.'
'You should care, Janet : if I were what I once was, I
would try to make you care— but — a sightless block I'
He relapsed again into gloom. I, on the contrary,
became more cheerful, and took fresh courage : these last
words gave me an insight as to where the difficulty lay ; and
as it was no difficulty with me, I felt quite relieved from my
previous embarrassment. I resumed a livelier vein of con-
versation.
'It is time some one undertook to rehtmianise you,'
said I, parting his thick and long uncut locks ;'for I see
you are being metamorphosed into a lion, or something of
that sort You have a " faux air " of Nebuchadnezzar in the
fields about you, that is certain : your hair reminds me of
eagle's feathers ; whether your nails are grown like bird's
daws or not, I have not yet noticed.'
'On this arm I have neither hand nor nails,'he said,
drawing the mutilated limb from his breast, and showing it

to me. * It is a mere stamp— a ghastly sight I Dont joa
think 80, Jane?'
'It is a pity to see it; and a pity to see your eyes— anl
the scar of fire on your forehead : and the worst of it is, one
is in danger of loving you too well for all this ; and " ^^ " g
too much of yon.*
'I thought you would be revolted, Jane^ when yoa saw
my arm and my cicatrised visage.*
'Did you? Don't tell me so — ^lest I should say some-
thing disparaging to your judgment. Now, let me leav^
you an instant, to make a better fire, and have the hearth
swept up. Can you tell when there is a good fire 7'
* Yes , with the right eye I see a glow — a mddy haae.*
'And you see the candles?'
* Very dimly— each is a luminous dood.*
'Can you see me?'
* No, my fairy : but I am only too thankful to hear and
feel you.'
'When do you take supper 7 *
* I never take supper.'
'But you shall have some to-night. I am hungry : so
are you, I daresay, only you forget.'
Summoning Mary, I soon had the room in more cheerful
order : I prepared him, likewise, a comfortable repast. My
spirits were excited, and with pleasure and ease I talked to
him during supper, and for a long time after. There vTas
no harassing restraint, no repressing of glee and vivacity
with him ; for with him I was at perfect ease, because I
knew I suited him : all I said or did seemed either to console
or revive him. Delightful consciousness! It brought to
life and light my whole nature : in his presence I thoroughly
lived; and he lived in mine. Blind as he was, smiles
played over his face, joy dawned on his forehead; his
lineaments softened and warmed.
After supper he began to ask me many questions, of
where I had been, what I had been doing, how I had found
him out ; but I gave him only very partial replies : it

too laie to enter into particulars that night. Besides, I
wished to touch no deep-thrilling chord — ^to open no fresh
well of emotion in his heart : my sole present aim was to
cheer him. Cheered, as I have said, he was : and yet but
by fits. If a moment's silence broke the conversation, he
would turn restless, touch me, then say,'Jane.'
'You are altogether a himian being, Jane? You are
certain of that ?''
'I conscientiously believe so, Mr. Bochester.'
'Yet how, on this dark and doleful evening, could you so
suddenly rise on my lone hearth ? I stretched my hand to
take a glass of water from a hireling, and it was given me
by you : I asked a question, expecting John's wife to answer
me, and your voice spoke at my ear.'
'Because I had come in, in Mary's stead, with the tray.'
* And there is enchantment in tiie very hour I am now
spending with you. Who can tell what a dark, dreary,
hopeless life I have dragged on for months past ? Doing
nothing, expecting nothing ; merging night in day ; feeling
but the sensation of cold when I let the fire go out, of hunger
when I forgot to eat : and then a ceaseless sorrow, and, at
times, a very delirium of desire to behold my Jane again.
Yes : for her restoration I longed, far more than for that of
my lost sight. How can it be that Jane is with me, and
says she loves me ? Will she not depart as suddenly as she
came ? To-morrow, I fear, I shall find her no more.'
A common-place, practical reply, out of the train of hii
own disturbed ideas, was, I was sure, the best and most re-
assuring for him in this frame of mind. I passed my finger
over his eyebrows, and remarked that they were soorohsd,
and that I would apply something which should make them
grow as broad and black as ever.
'Where is the use of doing me gobd in any way, ben^
ficent spirit, when, at some fatal moment, you will again
desert me — passing like a shadow, whither and how to me
unknown; and for me remaining afterwards undiscover-
able?'

'Have you a pocket oomb aboat yon, nr?'
•What for, Jane?'
* Just to comb out tbis shaggy black mane. I find yoa
rather alarming when I examine you close al hand : yoa
talk of my bdng a fairy ; but I am sure yoa are more like a
brownie.'
'Am I hideous* Jane?'
'Very, sir : you always wen^ yoa know.'
'Hmnph! The wickedness has not been taken oat olyoOp
wherever yoa have sojoamed.'
'Yet I have been with good people; far better than yoa :
a bondred times better people; possessed of ideae and views
yoa never entertained in your life : quite more refined and
exalted.'
'Who the deuce have you been with?'
* If you twist in that way you will make me puD the
hair out of your head ; and tiien I think you will cease to
entertain doubts of my substantiality.'
'Who have you been with, Jane?'
'You shall not get it out of me to-nig^t^ ar ; yoa must
wait till to-morrow; to leave my tale half told will, yoa
know, be a sort of security that I shall appear at your break-
fast table to finish it. By-ihe-bye, I must mind not to rise
on your hearth with only a glass of water, then : I must
bring an egg at the least, to say nothing of fried ham.'

leave you : I have been travelling these last three days, and I
believe I am tired. Good-night.'
'Just one word, Jane: were there only ladies in the

upstairs.'A good idea I'I thought^ with g^ee.'I see I

have the means of fretting him out of his melancholy for
some time to come.*
Very early the next morning I heard him up and astir,
wandering from one room to another. As soon as Mary
came down I heard the question;'Is Miss Eyre here?'
Then ;'Whioh room did you put her into? Was it dry ?
Is she up? Qo and ask if she wants anything; and when
she will oome down.'
I oame down as soon as I thought there was a prospect
of breakfast. Entering the room very softly, I had a view
of him before he discovered my presence. - It was mournful
indeed to witness the subjugation of that vigorous spirit to
a corporeal infirmityt He sat in his chaiTt — still, but not at
rest : expectant evidently ; the lines of now habitual sadness
marking his strong features. His countenance reminded
one of a lamp quenched, waiting to be relit — and alas I it
was not himself that could now kindle the lustre of animated
expression : he was dependent on another for that office I I
had meant to be gay and careless, but the powerlessness of the
strong man touched my heart to the quick : still I accosted
him with what vivacity I could :'It is a bright, sunny
morning, sir,'I said.'The rain is over and gone, and there
isa tender shining after it: you shaU have a walk soon.'
I had wakened the glow : his features beamed.
* Oh, you are indeed there, my sky -lark I Gome to me.
Tou are not gone : not vanished ? I heard one of your kind
an hour ago, singing high over the wood : but its song had
no music for me, any more than the rising sun had rays.
All the melody on earth is concentrated in my Jane's
tongue to my ear (I am glad it b not naturaUy a silent one) :
all the sunshine I can feel is in her presence.'
The water stood in my eyes to hear this avowal of his
dependence: just as if a royal eagle, chained €b a perch,
should be forced to entreat a sparrow to become its purveyor.
But I would not be lachrymose : I dashed off the salt drops,
and busied myself with preparing breakfast.
Most of the morning was spent in the open air. I led

him -mt of the wist and wild wood into some cheerful fields:
I described to him how brilliantly green they were ; how the
flowers and hedges looked refreshed ; how vptaUin^ bfaia
was the sky. I sought a seat for him in a hidden aodlovely
spot: adrystmnpof a tree: nor did I refuse to let him, uriien
seated, plaoe me on his knee: why should I, when both he and
I were happier near than apart? Pilot lay beside us: all was
quiet. He broke oat'suddenly while dasinng me in his
arms :'Gruel, cruel deserterl Oh, Jane, what did I feel
when I discovered you had fled from Thomfield, and when
I could nowhere find you; and, after examining your
apartment, ascertained that you had taken no money, nor
anything which could^ serve as an equivalent I A peail neok-
lace I had given you lay untouched in its little casket ; your
trunks were left corded and locked as they had been prepared
for the bridal tour. What could my darUng do, I asked, left
destitute and penniless? And what did she do 7 Let me
hear now.*
Thus urged, I began the narrative of my experience for
the last year. I softened considerably what rdated to the
three days of wandering and starvation, because to have
told him all would have been to inflict unnecessary pain :
the little I did say lacerated his faithful heart deeper than I
wished.
I should not have left him thus, he said, without any
means of making my way: I should have told him my
intention. I should have confided in him : he would never
have forced me to be his mistress. Violent as he had
seemed in his despair, he, in truth, loved me far too well
and too tenderly to constitute himself my tyrant: he would
have given me half his fortune, without demanding so much
as a kiss in return, rather than I should have flung myself
friendless on the wide world. I had endured, he was
certain, more than I had confessed to him.
'Well, whatever my sufferings had been, they were very
shorty'I answered : and then I proceeded to tell him how I
had been received at Moor House ; how I had obtained the

office of sohoolmistress, fto. The accession of fortune, ihe
discovery of my relations, followed in due order. Of course
St. John Bivers'name came in frequently in the progress
of my tale. When I had done that name was immediately
taken up.
'This St. John, then, b your cousin ? *
'You have spoken of him often : do you like him?*
'He was a very good man, sir ; I could not help liking
him.'
*A good man? Does that mean a respectable, well-
conducted man ot fifty? Or what does it mean?'
* St. John was only twenty-nine, sir.'
'" Jeune encore^*'as the French say. Is he a person of
low stature, phlegmatic, and plain ? A person whose good-
ness oondsts rather in his guiltlessness o( vice than in his
prowess in virtue ?'
'He is untiringly active. Great and exalted deeds are
what he lives to perfonn.'
'But his brain? That is probably rather soft? He
means well: but you shrug your shoulders to hear him
talk?'
'He talks little, sir : what he does say is ever to the
point. His brain is first-rate, I should think not impres-
sible, but vigorous.'
* Is he an able man, then ?'
* Truly able.'
* A thoroughly educated man ?'
* St John is an accomplished and profound scholar.'
'His manners, I think, you said are not to your taste ? —
priggish and parsonic ?'
'I never mentioned his manners; but, unless I had a
very bad taste, they must suit it ; they are polished, calm,
and gentlemanlike.'
'His appearance, — I forget what description you gave of
his appearance; — a sort of raw curate, half -strangled with

I perceived, of oonrse, the drift of my interlooator.
Jealousy had got hold of him : she stong him ; bot the sting
was salutary : it gave him respite from the gnawing fang ot
melanoholy. I would nbt» therefore, immediately oharm
the snake.
'Perhaps you would rather not sit any longer on my
knee, Miss Eyre?'was the next somewhat nnexpeoled
observation.
'Why not, Mr. Boohester?'
'The picture you have just .drawn is suggestive oi a
rather too overwhelming contrast Tour words have
delineated very prettily a graceful. Apollo : he is present to
your imagination, — taU, fair, blue-eyed, and with a Grecian
profile. Your eyes dwell on a Vulcan, — a real Uaoksmith,
brown, broad-shouldered; and blind and lame into the
bargain.'

rather like Vulcan, sir.'

'Who is that?'
* Yon know — this St John Bivers.*
'He is not my husband, nor ever will be. He does not
love me : I do not love him. He loves (as he can love, and
that is not as you love) a beautiful young lady called Bosa-
mond. He wanted to marry me only because he thought I
should make a suitable missionary's wife, which she would
not have done. He is good and great, but severe ; and, for
me, cold as an iceberg. He is not like you, sir : I am not
happy at his side, nor near him, nor with him. He has no
indulgence for me— no fondness. He sees nothing attractive
in me; not even youth — only a few useful mental points. —
Then I must leave you, sir, to go to him?'
I shuddered involuntarily, and clung instinctively doser
to my blind but beloved master. He smiled.
'What» Jane I Is this true? Is such really the state of
matters between you and Bivers?'
'Absolutely, sir. Oh, you need not be jealous I I wanted
to tease you a little to make you less sad : I thought anger
would be better than grief. But if you wish me to love you,
could you but see how much I do love you, you would be
proud and content. All my heart is yours, sir : it belongs to
you ; and with^you it would remain were fate to exile the
rest of me from your presence for ever.*
Afpin, as he kissed me, painful thoughts darkened his
aspect
* My seared vision I my crippled strength I'he murmured
regretfully.
I caressed, in order to soothe him. I knew of what he
was thinking, and wuited to speak for him ; but dared not
As he turned aside his face a minute I saw a tear slide from
under the sealed eyelid, and trickle down the manly cheek.
My heJEurt swelled.
'I am no better than the old lightning-struck chestnut-
tree in Thomfield orchard,* he remarked ere long.'And
what right would that ruin have to bid a budding woodbine
cover its decay with freshness ?'

whether you ask them or noft^ because thoy take delBi^ m
your bountiful shadow; and as they grow tbey will Ibni

Again he snuled : I gave bim comfori.
'You speak of friends, Jane?'be asked.
'Yes : of friends,'I answered rather hentstin(^y : lor I
knew I meant more than friends, but oonld noi tell iriial
other word to employ. He helped me.
'Ah 1 Jane. But I want a wife.'

'Yes : is it news to you?'
* Of course : you said nothing about it before.*
* Is it unwelcome news ?'
* That depends on drcumstances, ur— on your ohoioa.*

your decision.'

you will have to wait on ?'
* Yes, sir.'
•Truly, Jane?'
* Most truly, nr.'
'Oh 1 my darling 1 God bless you and reward yon I *
* Mr. Bochester, if ever I did a good deed in my life — ^if
ever I thought a good thought — if ever I prayed a sincere and
blameless prayer — ^if ever I wished a righteous wish, — ^I am
rewarded now. To be your wife is, for me, to be as happy
as I can be on earth.'

* Because you delight in sacrifice.'
'Sacrifice I What do I sacrifice ? Famine for food,
expectation for content. To be privileged to put my arms
round what I value — to press my lips to what I love — to
repose on what I trust: is that to make a sacrifice? If
so, then certainly I delight in sacrifice.'
'And to bear with my infirmities, Jane : to overlook my
defidendes.'
'Which are none, sir, to me. I love you better now,
when I can really be useful to you, than I did in your state
of proud independence, when you disdained every part but
that of the giver and protector.'
'Hitherto I have hated to.be helped — to be led : hence-
forth, I feel, I shall hate it no more. I did not like to put
my hand into a hireling's, but it is pleasant to feel it circled
by Jane's little fingers. I preferred utter loneliness to the
constant attendance of servants ; but Jane's soft ministry
will be a perpetual joy. Jane suits me : do I suit her ?'
'To the finest fibre of my nature, sir.'
'The case being so, we have nothing in the world to
wait for : we must be married instantly.'
He looked and spoke with eagerness : his old impetuosity
was rising.
'We must become one flesh without any delay, Jane :
there is but the licence to get — then we marry.'
'Mr. Bochester, I have just discovered the sun is far
declined from its meridian, and Pilot is actually gone home
to his dinner. Let me look at your watch.'
'Fasten it. into your girdle, Janet, and keep it hence*
forward : I have no use for it.'
'It is nearly four o'clock in the afternoon, sir. Don't you
feel hungry?'
'The third day from this must be our wedding-day, Jane.
Never mind fine clothes and jewels now : all that i^ not
worth a fillip.'

'Do you know, Jane, I have your litde pearl necUaee aft
t)u8 moment fastened round my bronjBe scrag under my
crayat? Ihave womit since the day I lost my only treasoze :
as a memento of her.'
'We will go home through the wood : thai will be the
shadiest way.'
He pursued his own thoughts without heeding me.
'Jane 1 you think me, I daresay, an irreligious dog : but
my heart swells with gratitude to the benefioent God of this
ea^ just now. He sees not as man sees, but Car clearer :
judges not as man judges, but far more wisely. I did wrong :
I would have sullied my innocent flower — breathed guOt on
its purity : the Omnipotent snatched it from me. I, in my
stiff-necked rebellion, almost cursed the dispensation : instw^l
of bending to the decree, I defied it. Divine justice pursued
its course; disasters came thick on me: I was forced to
pass through the valley of the shadow of death. His
chastisements are mighty ; and one smote me which has
humbled me for ever. You know I was proud of my
strength ; but what is it now, when I must give it over to
foreign guidance, as a child does its weakness*? Of late.
Jane — only — only of late — I began to see and acknowledge
the hand of God in my doom. I began to experience remorse,
repentance; the widi for reconcilement to my Maker. I
began sometimes to pray : very brief prayers they were, but
very sincere.
'Some days since: nay, I can number them — ^four; it
was last Monday night, a singular mood came over me : one
in which grief replaced frenzy — sorrow, suUenness. I had
long had the impression that since I could nowhere find
you, you must be dead. Late that night — perhaps it might
be between eleven and twelve o'clock — ere I retired to my
dreary rest, I supplicated God that, if it seemed good to
Him» I might soon be taken from this life, and admitted
to that world to come, where there was still hope of rejoining
Jane.

though I could see no stars and only by a vague, luminous
haze, knew the presence of a moon. I longed for thee*
Janet I Oh, I longed for thee both with soul and flesh I I
asked of God, at once in anguish and humility, if I had not
been long enough desolate, afSicted, tormented ; and might
not soon taste bliss and peace once more. That I merited
all I endured I acknowledged — ^that I could scarcely endure
more I pleaded; and the Alpha and Omega of my heart's
wishes broke involuntarily from my lips in the wcrds-r

have thought me mad : I pronounced them with such fraiitio
energy.*

a hill-sent echo repeat the words. Cooler and fresher at the

deemed that in some wild, lone scene, I and Jane were

CHAPTEB XXXVm
OONGLUSION
Beadbb, I married him. A quiet wedding we had : he and
I9 the parson and clerk, were alone present. When we got
back from church, I went into the kitchen of the manor-house,
where Mary was cooking the dinner, and John cleaning the
knives, and I said:'Mary, I have been married to Mr.
Bochester this morning.'The housekeeper and her husband
were both of that decent phlegmatic order of people to whom
one may at any time safely conmiunicate a remarkable piece
of news without incurring the danger of having one's ears
pierced by some shrill ejaculation, and subsequentiy stunned
by a torrent of wordy wonderment. Mary did look up, and
she did stare at me : the ladle with which she was basting
a pair of chickens roasting at the ire did for some three
minutes hang suspended in air ; and for the same space ol
time John's knives also had rest from the polishing process :
but Mary, bending again over the roast, said only:'Have
yon. Miss? Well, for sure I'
A short time after she pursued :'I seed you go out with
the master, but I didn't know you were gone to church to
be wed;'and she basted away. John, when I turned to
him, was grinning from ear to ear.
'I telled Mary how it would be,'he said :'I knew what
Mr. Edward'(John was an old servant, and had known his
master when he was the cadet of the house, therefore he often
gave him his Christian name) —'I knew what Mr. Edward
would do; and I was certain he would not wut long ndther:

Diana annoonoed that she wcold jost g^ me time to gel
orer the honeymoon, and then she woold oome and see me.
'She bed better not wait till then, Jane,'said Mr.
Bochester, when I read her letter to him;'if she does, she
win he too late, for oor honeynKxm will shine oor life-long:
its beams iffill only tide over your gisTe or mine.'
How SL John reoerred the news I dcm't know; he neier
answered the letter in wbieh I ooomianicated it: yet six
months after he wrote to me ; withoot, however, mentioning
Mr. Bochester's name, or aUoding to my marriage. Hie
letter was then calm : and though very serioos, kind. Ha
has maintained a regular, thon^ not frequent correspondenee
erer since : he hopes I am happy, and trusts I am not of
those who Utc without God in the world, and only mind
earthly things.
You have not quite forgotten Utile Adtie, have ytyo,
reader? I had not; I soon asked and obtained leave of
Mr. Bochester to go and'see her at the school where he had
placed her. Her frantic joy at beholding me again nK > ved
me much. She looked pale and thin : she said she was not
happy. I found the rules of the establishment were too
strict^ its course of study too severe, for a child of her age :
I took her home with me. I meant to become her governess
once more; but I soon found this impracticable; my time

and cares were now required by another — my husband needed
ihem all. So I sought out a school conducted on a more
mdulgent system ; and near enough to permit of my visiting
her often, and bringing her home sometimes. I took care
she should never want for anything that could contribute
to her comfort: she soon settled in her new abode,
became very happy there, and made fair progress in her
studies. As she grew up a sound English education cor-
rected in a great measure her French defects; and when
she left school I found in her a pleasing and oblipng
companion : docile, good-tempered, and well-principled.
By her grateful, attention to me and mine she has long
since well repaid any little kindness I ever had in my power
to ofiTer her.
My tale draws to its dose : one word respecting my
experience of married life, and one brief glance at the
fortunes of those whose names have most frequently
recurred in this narrative, and I have done.
I have now been married ten years. I know what it is
to Hve entirely for and with what I love best on earth. I
hold myself supremely blest — ^blest beyond what language
can express ; because I am my husband's life as fully as he
is mine. No woman was ever nearer to her mate than I
am ; ever more absolutely bone of his bone and flesh ol his
flesh.
I know no weariness of my Edward's society : he knows
none of mine, any more than we each do of the pulsation of
the heart that beats in our separate bosoms ; consequently,
we are ever together. To be together is for us to be at once
as free as in solitude, as gay as in company. We talk, I
believe, all day long : to talk to each other is but a more
animated and an audible thinking. All my confidence is
bestowed on him, all his confidence is devoted to me ; we
are precisely suited in character — ^perfect concord is the
result
Mr. Bochester continued blind the first two years of our
union : perhaps it was that circumstance thai drew us so

as I am still his right hand. literally, I was (what be often
called me) the apple of his eye. He saw natoio — ^he saw
books through me ; and never did I weary of gasing for his
behalf, and of patting into words the e£Eeet of field, tree,
town, river, doad, sunbeam — of the landscape before ns ; of
the weather round us— and impressing by sound on his ear
what light could no longer stamp on his eye. Never did I
weary of reading to him : never did I weary of conducting
him where he wished to go : of doing for him what he vrished
to be done. And there was a pleasure in my services, most
full, most exquisite, even though sad^because he claimed
these services without painful shame or damping humilia-
tion. He loved me so truly that he knew no reluctance in
profiting by my attendance : he felt I loved him so fcmdly
that to yield that attendance was to indulge my sweetest
vrishes.
One morning at the end of the two years, as I was writing
a letter to his dictation, he came and bent over me, and
said —'Jane, have you a glittering ornament round your
neck?'
I had a gold watch-chain : I answered,'Yes.'
'And have you a pale blue dress on 7'
I had. He informed me then that for some time be
had fancied the obscurity clouding one eye was becoming
less dense ; and that now he was sure of it.
He and I went up to London. He had the advice of an
eminent oculist; and he eventually recovered the sight of
that one eye. He cannot now see very distinctiy : he cannot
read or write much ; but he can find his way without being
led by the hand : the sky is no longer a blank to him — ^the
earth no longer a void. When his firstborn was put into
his arms, he could see that the boy had inherited his own
eyes, as they once were — ^large, brilliant, and Uack. On that
occasion he again, with a full heart, acknowledged that God
ha^ tempered judgment with mercy.
My Edward and I, then, are happy : and the more so

because those we most love are happy likewise. Diana and
Mary Bivers are both married : alternately, once eyery year,
they come to see us, and we go to see them. Diana's
husband is a captain in the navy; a gallant officer and a
good man. Mary's is a clergyman : a college friend of her
brother's ; and, brom his attainments and principlesy worthy
of the conn^tion. Both Captain Rtzjames and Mr.
Wharton love their wives, and are loved by thenu
As to St John Bivers, he left England : he went to
India. He entered on the path he b ^ marked for himself ;
he pursues it stilL A more resolute, indefatigable pioneer
never wrought amidst rocks and dangers. Firm, fauthfol,
and devoted ; full of energy, and seal, and truth, he labours
for his race : he clears their painful way to improvement :
he hews down like a giant the prejudices of creed and caste
that encumber it. He may be stern ; he may be exacting:
he may be ambitious yet; but his is the sternness of the
warrior Greatheart, who guards his pilgrim convoy from the
onslaught of Apollyon. His is the exaction of the apostle,
who speaks but for Christ when he sajrs —'Whosoever will
come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his oroM
and follow Me.'His is the ambition of the high master-
spirit, wluch aims to fill a place in the first rank of those
* . . who are redeemed from the earth — ^who stand without fault
^'before the throne of God; who share the last mighty
victories of the Lamb; who are called, and chosen, and
faithfuL
St. John is unmarried: he never will marry now.
Himself* has hitherto sufficed to the toil; and the toil draws
near its close : his glorious sun hastens to its setting. The
last letter I received from him drew from my eyes human
tears, and yet filled my heart with Divine joy : heantidpated'
his sure reward, his incorruptible crown. I know that a
stranger's hand will write to me next, to say that the good
and faithful servant has been called at length into the joy v''
his Lord. And why weep for this ? No fear of death wil ^
darken St John's last hour : his mind will be unclouded *
