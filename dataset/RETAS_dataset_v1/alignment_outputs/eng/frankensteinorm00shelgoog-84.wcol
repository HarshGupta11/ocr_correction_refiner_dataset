PREFACE	null
npHE	null
event	null
on	null
which	null
this	null
fiction	null
is	null
founded	null
has	null
been	null
supposed	null
by	null
Dr	null
Darwin	null
and	null
some	null
of	null
the	null
physiological	null
writers	null
of	null
Germany	null
as	null
not	null
of	null
impossible	null
occurrence	null
I	null
shall	null
not	null
be	null
supposed	null
as	null
recording	null
the	null
remotest	null
degree	null
of	null
serious	null
faith	null
to	null
such	null
an	null
imagination	null
yet	null
in	null
assuming	null
it	null
as	null
the	null
basis	null
of	null
a	null
work	null
of	null
fancy	null
I	null
have	null
not	null
considered	null
myself	null
as	null
merely	null
weaving	null
a	null
series	null
of	null
supernatural	null
terrors	null
The	null
event	null
on	null
which	null
the	null
interest	null
of	null
the	null
story	null
depends	null
is	null
exempt	null
from	null
the	null
disadvantages	null
of	null
a	null
mere	null
tale	null
of	null
spectres	null
or	null
enchantment	null
It	null
was	null
recommended	null
by	null
the	null
novelty	null
of	null
the	null
situations	null
which	null
it	null
develops	null
and	null
however	null
impossible	null
as	null
a	null
physical	null
fact	null
affords	null
a	null
point	null
of	null
view	null
to	null
the	null
imagination	null
for	null
the	null
delineating	null
of	null
human	null
passions	null
more	null
comprehensive	null
and	null
commanding	null
than	null
any	null
which	null
the	null
ordinary	null
relations	null
of	null
existing	null
events	null
can	null
yield	null
I	null
have	null
thus	null
endeavored	null
to	null
preserve	null
the	null
truth	null
of	null
the	null
elementary	null
principles	null
of	null
human	null
nature	null
while	null
I	null
have	null
not	null
scrupled	null
to	null
innovate	null
upon	null
their	null
combinations	null
The	null

tragic	null

of	null

conform	null
to	null
this	null
rule	null
and	null
the	null
most	null
humble	null
novelist	null
who	null
seeks	null
to	null
confer	null
or	null
receive	null
amusement	null
from	null
his	null
labors	null
may	null
without	null
presumption	null
apply	null
to	null
prose	null
fiction	null
a	null
license	null
or	null
rather	null
a	null
rule	null
from	null
the	null
adoption	null
of	null
which	null
so	null
many	null
exquisite	null
combinations	null
of	null
human	null
feelvxv	null
have	null
resulted	null

and	null
partly	null
as	null
an	null
expedient	null
for	null
exercising	null
any	null
untried	null
resources	null
of	null
mind	null
Other	null
motives	null
were	null
mingled	null
with	null
these	null
as	null
the	null
work	null
proceeded	null
I	null
am	null
by	null
no	null
means	null
indifferent	null
to	null
the	null
manner	null
in	null
which	null
whatever	null
moral	null
tendencies	null
exist	null
in	null
the	null
sentiments	null
or	null
characters	null
it	null
contains	null
shall	null
afect	null
the	null
reader	null
yet	null
my	null
chief	null
concern	null
in	null
this	null
respect	null
has	null
been	null
limited	null
to	null
the	null
avoiding	null
the	null
enervating	null
effects	null
of	null
the	null
novels	null
of	null
the	null
present	null
day	null
and	null
to	null
the	null
exhibition	null
of	null
the	null
amiableness	null
of	null
domestic	null
affection	null
and	null
the	null
excellence	null
of	null
tmiversal	null
virtue	null
The	null
opinions	null
which	null
naturally	null
spring	null
from	null
the	null
character	null
and	null
situation	null
of	null
the	null
hero	null
are	null
by	null
no	null
means	null
to	null
be	null
conceived	null
as	null
existing	null
always	null
in	null
my	null
own	null
conviction	null
nor	null
is	null
any	null
inference	null
justly	null
to	null
be	null
drawn	null
from	null
the	null
following	null
pages	null
as	null
prejudicing	null
any	null
philosophical	null
doctrine	null
of	null
whatever	null
kind	null
It	null
is	null
a	null
subject	null
also	null
of	null
additional	null
interest	null
to	null
the	null
author	null
that	null
this	null
story	null
was	null
begun	null
in	null
the	null
majestic	null
region	null
where	null
the	null
scene	null
is	null
principally	null
laid	null
and	null
in	null
society	null
which	null
cannot	null
cease	null
to	null
be	null
regretted	null
I	null
passed	null
the	null
summer	null
of	null
in	null
the	null
environs	null
of	null
Geneva	null
The	null
season	null
was	null
cold	null
and	null
rainy	null
and	null
in	null
the	null
evenings	null
we	null
crowded	null
around	null
a	null
blazing	null
wood	null
fire	null
and	null
occasionally	null
amused	null
ourselves	null
with	null
some	null
German	null
stories	null
of	null
ghosts	null
hich	null
happened	null
to	null
fall	null
into	null
our	null
hands	null
These	null
tales	null
excited	null
in	null
us	null
a	null
plajrful	null
desire	null
of	null
imitation	null
Two	null
other	null
friends	null
a	null
tale	null
from	null
the	null
pen	null
of	null
one	null
of	null
whom	null
would	null
be	null
far	null
more	null
acceptable	null
to	null
the	null
public	null
than	null
any	null
thing	null
I	null
can	null
ever	null
hope	null
to	null
produce	null
and	null
myself	null
agreed	null
to	null
write	null
each	null
a	null
story	null
founded	null
on	null
some	null
supernatural	null
occiurence	null
The	null
weather	null
however	null
suddenly	null
became	null
serene	null
and	null
my	null
two	null
friends	null
left	null
me	null
on	null
a	null
journey	null
among	null
the	null
Alps	null
and	null
lost	null
in	null
the	null
magnificent	null
scenes	null
which	null
they	null
present	null
all	null
memory	null
of	null
their	null
ghostly	null
visions	null
The	null
following	null
tale	null
is	null
the	null
only	null
one	null
which	null
has	null
been	null

of	null

Standard	null
Novels	null
in	null
selecting	null
Frankenstein	null
for	null
one	null
of	null
tfieir	null

expressed	null
a	null
wish	null
that	null
I	null
should	null
furnish	null
them	null
with	null
some	null
account	null
of	null
the	null
origin	null
of	null
the	null
story	null
I	null
am	null
the	null
more	null
willing	null
to	null
comply	null
because	null
I	null
shall	null
thus	null
gve	null
a	null
general	null
answer	null
to	null
the	null
question	null
so	null
very	null
frequently	null
asked	null
me	null
How	null
I	null
then	null
a	null
young	null
girl	null
came	null
to	null
think	null
of	null
and	null
to	null
dilate	null
upon	null
so	null
very	null
hideous	null
an	null
idea	null
It	null
is	null
true	null
that	null
I	null
am	null
very	null
averse	null
to	null
bringing	null
myself	null
forward	null
in	null
print	null
but	null
as	null
my	null
account	null
will	null
only	null
appear	null
as	null
an	null
appendage	null
to	null
a	null
former	null
production	null
and	null
as	null
it	null
will	null
be	null
confined	null
to	null
such	null
topics	null
as	null
have	null
connection	null
with	null
my	null
authorship	null
alone	null
I	null
can	null
scarcely	null
accuse	null
myself	null
of	null
a	null
personal	null
intrusion	null
It	null
is	null
not	null
singular	null
that	null
as	null
the	null
daughter	null
of	null
two	null
persons	null
of	null
distinguished	null
literary	null
celebrity	null
I	null
should	null
very	null
early	null
in	null
life	null
have	null
thought	null
of	null
writing	null
As	null
a	null
child	null
I	null
scribbled	null
and	null
my	null
favorite	null
pastime	null
during	null
the	null
hours	null
given	null
me	null
for	null
recreation	null
was	null
to	null
write	null
stories	null
Still	null
I	null
had	null
a	null
dearer	null
pleasure	null
than	null
this	null
which	null
was	null
the	null
formation	null
of	null
castles	null
in	null
the	null
air	null
the	null
indulging	null
in	null
waking	null
dreams	null
the	null
following	null
up	null
trains	null
o	null
thought	null
which	null
had	null
for	null
their	null
subject	null
the	null
formation	null
of	null
a	null
succession	null
of	null
imaginary	null
incidents	null
My	null
dreams	null
were	null
at	null
once	null
more	null
fantastic	null
and	null
agreeable	null
than	null
my	null
writings	null
In	null
the	null
latter	null
I	null
was	null
a	null
close	null
imitator	null

rather	null

on	null

some	null

about	null

who	null
was	null
so	null
punished	null
for	null
peeping	null
through	null
a	null
keyhole—	null

to	null

I	null

—	null
something	null
very	null
shocking	null
and	null
wrong	null
of	null
course	null
but	null
when	null
she	null
was	null
reduced	null
to	null
a	null
worse	null
condition	null
than	null
the	null
renowned	null
Tom	null
of	null
Coventry	null
he	null
did	null
not	null
know	null
what	null
to	null
do	null
with	null
her	null
and	null
was	null
obliged	null
to	null
despatch	null
her	null
to	null
the	null
tomb	null
of	null
the	null
Capulets	null
the	null
only	null
place	null
for	null
which	null
she	null
was	null
fitted	null
The	null
illustrious	null
poets	null
also	null
annoyed	null
by	null
the	null
platitude	null
of	null
prose	null
speedily	null
relinquished	null
their	null
uncongenial	null
task	null
I	null
busied	null
myself	null
to	null
think	null
of	null
a	null
story	null
—	null
a	null
story	null
to	null
rival	null
those	null
whic	null
had	null
excited	null
us	null
to	null
this	null
task	null
One	null
which	null
would	null
speak	null
to	null
the	null
mysterious	null
fears	null
of	null
our	null
nature	null
and	null
awaking	null
thrilling	null
horror	null
—	null
one	null

make	null
the	null
reader	null
dread	null

look	null
round	null
to	null
curdle	null
the	null
blood	null
andquicken	null

If	null
I	null

not	null
accomplish	null
these	null
things	null
my	null
ghost	null

would	null
be	null
unworthy	null
of	null
its	null

I	null
thought	null
and	null
pondered	null
vainly	null
I	null
felt	null
that	null
blank	null
incapability	null
of	null

which	null
is	null
the	null
greatest	null
misery	null
of	null

I	null
was	null
forced	null

with	null

A	null
PRBFACS	null
IX	null
vention	null
consists	null
in	null
the	null
capacity	null
of	null
seizing	null
on	null
the	null
capabilities	null
of	null
a	null
subject	null
and	null
in	null
the	null
power	null
of	null
moulding	null
and	null
fashioning	null
ideas	null
suggested	null
to	null
it	null
Many	null
and	null
long	null
were	null
the	null
conrersations	null
between	null
Lord	null
Byron	null
and	null
Shelley	null
to	null
which	null
I	null
was	null
a	null
devout	null
but	null
nearly	null
silent	null
listener	null
During	null
one	null
of	null
these	null
various	null
philosophical	null
doctrines	null
were	null
discussed	null
and	null
among	null
others	null
the	null
nature	null
of	null
the	null
principle	null
of	null
life	null
and	null
whether	null
there	null
was	null
any	null
probability	null
of	null
its	null
ever	null
being	null
discovered	null
and	null
communicated	null
They	null
talked	null
of	null
the	null
experiments	null
of	null
Dr	null
Darwin	null
I	null
speak	null
not	null
of	null
what	null
the	null
Doctor	null
really	null
did	null
or	null
said	null
he	null
did	null
but	null
as	null
more	null
to	null
my	null
purpose	null
of	null
what	null
was	null
then	null
spoken	null
of	null
as	null
having	null
been	null
done	null
by	null
himvho	null
preserved	null

by	null

a	null

Night	null
waned	null
upon	null
this	null

even	null
the	null
witching	null
hour	null
had	null
gone	null
by	null
before	null

my	null
mind	null
with	null
a	null

beyond	null

of	null
unhallowed	null
arts	null
kneeling	null
beside	null
the	null
thing	null
he	null
had	null
put	null
together	null
I	null
saw	null
the	null
hideous	null
phantasm	null
of	null
a	null

stretched	null
out	null

then	null
on	null

Frightful	null

the	null

I	null
opened	null

terror	null
The	null

so	null
possessed	null
my	null
mind	null
that	null
a	null
thrill	null
of	null
fear	null
ran	null
through	null
me	null
and	null
I	null
wished	null
to	null
exchange	null
the	null
ghastly	null
image	null
of	null
my	null
fancy	null
for	null
the	null
realities	null
around	null
I	null
see	null

I	null
could	null
not	null

get	null
rid	null
of	null
my	null
hideous	null
phantom	null
still	null
it	null
haunted	null
me	null
I	null

try	null

Oh	null

frightened	null
that	null
night	null
Swift	null
as	null

as	null
cheering	null
was	null
the	null
idea	null
that	null
broke	null
in	null
upon	null
me	null
I	null

it	null
What	null
terrified	null
me	null
null	Mrs
null	Saville
null	England
null	You
will	will
terrify	null
others	null
and	null
I	null
need	null
only	null
describe	null
the	null
spectre	null
which	null
had	null
haunted	null
my	null
midnight	null
pillow	null
On	null
the	null
morrow	null
I	null
announced	null
that	null
I	null
had	null
thought	null
of	null
a	null
story	null
I	null
began	null
that	null
day	null
with	null
the	null
words	null
It	null
was	null
on	null
a	null
dreary	null
night	null
in	null
November	null
making	null
onty	null
a	null
transcript	null
of	null
the	null
grim	null
terrors	null
of	null
my	null
waking	null
dream	null
At	null
first	null
I	null
thought	null
but	null
of	null
a	null
few	null
pages	null
—	null
of	null
a	null
short	null
tale	null
but	null
Shelley	null
urged	null
me	null
to	null
develop	null
the	null
idea	null
at	null
greater	null
length	null
I	null
certainly	null
did	null
not	null
owe	null
the	null
suggestion	null
of	null
one	null
incident	null
nor	null
scarcely	null
of	null
one	null
train	null
of	null
feeling	null
to	null
my	null
husband	null
and	null
yet	null
but	null
for	null
his	null
incitement	null
it	null
would	null
never	null
have	null
taken	null
the	null
form	null
in	null
which	null
it	null
was	null
presented	null
to	null
the	null
world	null
From	null
this	null
declaration	null
I	null
must	null
except	null
the	null
preface	null
As	null
far	null
as	null
I	null
can	null
recollect	null
it	null
vtras	null
entirely	null
written	null
by	null
him	null
iflr	null
now	null

I	null
bid	null

and	null
prosper	null
I	null
have	null
an	null
affection	null

it	null
for	null
it	null
was	null
the	null
ofi	null
spring	null
of	null
happy	null
days	null
when	null
death	null
and	null
grief	null
were	null
but	null
words	null
which	null
found	null
no	null
true	null
echo	null
in	null
my	null
heart	null
Its	null
several	null
pages	null
speak	null
of	null
many	null
a	null

many	null

many	null
a	null

Her	null

During	null

we	null

we	null

at	null

We	null

that	null
the	null
