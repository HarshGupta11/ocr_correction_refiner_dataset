INTRODUCTION	null
In	null
considering	null
Dickens	null
as	null
we	null
almost	null
always	null
must	null
consider	null
him	null
as	null
a	null
man	null
of	null
startling	null
originality	null
we	null
may	null
possibly	null
miss	null
the	null
forces	null
from	null
which	null
he	null
drew	null
even	null
his	null
original	null
energy	null
It	null
is	null
not	null
well	null
for	null
man	null
to	null
be	null
alone	null
We	null
in	null
the	null
modern	null
world	null
are	null
ready	null
enough	null
to	null
admit	null
that	null
when	null
it	null
is	null
applied	null
to	null
some	null
problem	null
of	null
monasticism	null
or	null
of	null
an	null
ecstatic	null
life	null
But	null
we	null
will	null
not	null
admit	null
that	null
our	null
modern	null
claim	null
to	null
absolute	null
originality	null
is	null
really	null
a	null
claim	null
to	null
absolute	null
unsociability	null
a	null
claim	null
to	null
absolute	null
loneliness	null
The	null
anarchist	null
is	null
at	null
least	null
as	null
much	null
alone	null
as	null
the	null
I	null
ascetic	null
And	null
the	null
men	null
of	null
very	null
violent	null
vigour	null
in	null
literature	null
the	null
imen	null
such	null
as	null
Dickens	null
have	null
generally	null
displayed	null
a	null
large	null
sociaibility	null
towards	null
the	null
society	null
of	null
literature	null
always	null
expressed	null
in	null
ithe	null
happy	null
pursuit	null
of	null
preexistent	null
themes	null
sometimes	null
expressed	null
jas	null
in	null
the	null
cases	null
of	null
Molire	null
or	null
Sterne	null
in	null
downright	null
plagiarism	null
For	null
even	null
theft	null
is	null
a	null
confession	null
of	null
our	null
dependence	null
on	null
society	null
In	null
Dickens	null
however	null
this	null
element	null
of	null
the	null
original	null
foundations	null
on	null
which	null
he	null
worked	null
is	null
quite	null
especially	null
difficult	null
to	null
determine	null
This	null
is	null
partly	null
due	null
to	null
the	null
fact	null
that	null
for	null
the	null
present	null
reading	null
public	null
he	null
is	null
practically	null
the	null
only	null
one	null
of	null
his	null
long	null
line	null
that	null
is	null
read	null
at	null
all	null
He	null
sums	null
up	null
Smollett	null
and	null
Goldsmith	null
but	null
he	null
also	null
destroys	null
them	null
This	null
one	null
giant	null
being	null
closest	null
to	null
us	null
cuts	null
off	null
from	null
our	null
view	null
even	null
the	null
giants	null
that	null
begat	null
him	null
But	null
much	null
more	null
is	null
this	null
difficulty	null
due	null
to	null
the	null
fact	null
that	null
Dickens	null
mixed	null
up	null
with	null
the	null
old	null
material	null
materials	null
so	null
subtly	null
modern	null
so	null
made	null
of	null
the	null
French	null
Revolution	null
that	null
the	null
whole	null
is	null
transformed	null
If	null
we	null
want	null
the	null
best	null
example	null
of	null
this	null
the	null
best	null
example	null
is	null
Oliver	null
Twist	null
Relatively	null
to	null
the	null
other	null
works	null
of	null
Dickens	null
Oliver	null
Twist	null
is	null
not	null
of	null
great	null
value	null
but	null
it	null
is	null
of	null
great	null
importance	null
Some	null
parts	null
of	null
it	null
are	null
so	null
crude	null
and	null
of	null
so	null
clumsy	null
a	null
melodrama	null
that	null
one	null
is	null
almost	null
tempted	null
to	null
say	null
that	null
Dickens	null
would	null
have	null
been	null
greater	null
without	null
it	null
But	null
even	null
if	null
he	null
had	null
been	null
greater	null
without	null
it	null
he	null
would	null
still	null
have	null
been	null
incomplete	null
without	null
it	null
With	null
the	null
exception	null
of	null
some	null
gorgeous	null
passages	null
both	null
of	null
humour	null
and	null
horror	null
the	null
interest	null
of	null
the	null
book	null
lies	null
not	null
so	null
much	null
in	null
its	null
revelation	null
of	null
Dickensliterary	null
genius	null
as	null
in	null
its	null
revelation	null
of	null
those	null
vii	null
viii	null
Introduction	null
moral	null
personal	null
and	null
political	null
instincts	null
which	null
were	null
the	null
makeup	null
of	null
his	null
character	null
and	null
the	null
permanent	null
support	null
of	null
that	null
literary	null
genius	null
It	null
is	null
by	null
far	null
the	null
most	null
depressing	null
of	null
all	null
his	null
books	null
it	null
is	null
in	null
some	null
ways	null
the	null
most	null
irritating	null
yet	null
its	null
ugliness	null
gives	null
the	null
last	null
touch	null
of	null
honesty	null
to	null
all	null
that	null
spontaneous	null
and	null
splendid	null
output	null
Without	null
this	null
one	null
discordant	null
note	null
all	null
his	null
merriment	null
might	null
have	null
seemed	null
like	null
levity	null
But	null
in	null
order	null
adequately	null
to	null
appreciate	null
Oliver	null
Twist	null
we	null
must	null
first	null
remember	null
its	null
place	null
in	null
biography	null
and	null
chronology	null
Dickens	null
it	null
must	null
be	null
remembered	null
had	null
just	null
appeared	null
upon	null
the	null
stage	null
and	null
set	null
the	null
whole	null
world	null
laughing	null
with	null
his	null
first	null
great	null
story	null
Pickwick	null
Oliver	null
Twist	null
was	null
his	null
encore	null
It	null
was	null
the	null
second	null
opportunity	null
given	null
to	null
him	null
by	null
those	null
who	null
had	null
rolled	null
about	null
with	null
laughter	null
over	null
Tupman	null
and	null
Jingle	null
Weller	null
and	null
Dowler	null
Under	null
such	null
circumstances	null
a	null
stagey	null
reciter	null
will	null
sometimes	null
take	null
care	null
to	null
give	null
a	null
pathetic	null
piece	null
after	null
his	null
humorous	null
one	null
and	null
with	null
all	null
his	null
many	null
moral	null
merits	null
there	null
was	null
much	null
that	null
was	null
stagey	null
about	null
Dickens	null
But	null
this	null
explanation	null
alone	null
is	null
altogether	null
inadequate	null
and	null
unworthy	null
There	null
was	null
in	null
Dickens	null
this	null
other	null
kind	null
of	null
energy	null
horrible	null
uncanny	null
barbaric	null
capable	null
in	null
another	null
age	null
of	null
coarseness	null
greedy	null
for	null
the	null
emblems	null
of	null
established	null
ugliness	null
the	null
coffin	null
the	null
gibbet	null
the	null
bones	null
the	null
bloody	null
knife	null
Dickens	null
liked	null
these	null
things	null
and	null
he	null
was	null
all	null
the	null
more	null
of	null
a	null
man	null
for	null
liking	null
them	null
especially	null
he	null
was	null
all	null
the	null
more	null
of	null
a	null
boy	null
We	null
can	null
all	null
recall	null
with	null
pleasure	null
the	null
fact	null
that	null
Miss	null
Petowker	null
afterwards	null
Mrs	null
Lillyvick	null
was	null
in	null
the	null
habit	null
of	null
reciting	null
a	null
poem	null
called	null
The	null
Blood	null
Drinkers	null
Burial	null
I	null
cannot	null
express	null
my	null
regret	null
that	null
the	null
words	null
of	null
this	null
poem	null
are	null
not	null
given	null
for	null
Dickens	null
would	null
have	null
been	null
quite	null
as	null
capable	null
of	null
writing	null
The	null
Blood	null
Drinkers	null
Burial	null
as	null
Miss	null
Petowker	null
was	null
of	null
reciting	null
it	null
This	null
strain	null
existed	null
in	null
Dickens	null
alongside	null
of	null
his	null
happy	null
laughter	null
both	null
were	null
allied	null
to	null
the	null
same	null
robust	null
romance	null
Here	null
as	null
elsewhere	null
Dickens	null
is	null
close	null
to	null
all	null
the	null
permanent	null
human	null
things	null
He	null
is	null
close	null
to	null
religion	null
which	null
has	null
never	null
allowed	null
the	null
thousand	null
devils	null
on	null
its	null
churches	null
to	null
stop	null
the	null
dancing	null
of	null
its	null
bells	null
He	null
is	null
allied	null
to	null
the	null
people	null
to	null
the	null
real	null
poor	null
who	null
love	null
nothing	null
so	null
much	null
as	null
to	null
take	null
a	null
cheerful	null
glass	null
and	null
to	null
talk	null
about	null
funerals	null
The	null
extremes	null
of	null
his	null
gloom	null
and	null
gaiety	null
are	null
the	null
mark	null
of	null
religion	null
and	null
democracy	null
they	null
mark	null
him	null
off	null
from	null
the	null
moderate	null
happiness	null
of	null
philosophers	null
and	null
from	null
that	null
stoicism	null
which	null
is	null
the	null
virtue	null
and	null
the	null
creed	null
of	null
aristocrats	null
There	null
is	null
nothing	null
odd	null
in	null
the	null
fact	null
that	null
the	null
same	null
man	null
who	null
conceived	null
the	null
humane	null
hospitalities	null
of	null
Pickwick	null
should	null
also	null
have	null
imagined	null
Introduction	null
ix	null
the	null
inhuman	null
laughter	null
of	null
Fagins	null
den	null
They	null
are	null
both	null
genuine	null
and	null
they	null
are	null
both	null
exaggerated	null
And	null
the	null
whole	null
human	null
tradition	null
has	null
tied	null
up	null
together	null
in	null
a	null
strange	null
knot	null
these	null
strands	null
of	null
festivity	null
and	null
fear	null
It	null
is	null
over	null
the	null
cups	null
of	null
Christmas	null
Eve	null
that	null
men	null
have	null
always	null
competed	null
in	null
telling	null
ghost	null
stories	null
This	null
first	null
element	null
was	null
present	null
in	null
Dickens	null
and	null
it	null
is	null
very	null
powerfully	null
present	null
in	null
Oliver	null
Twist	null
It	null
had	null
not	null
been	null
present	null
with	null
sufficient	null
consistency	null
or	null
continuity	null
in	null
Pickwick	null
to	null
make	null
it	null
remain	null
on	null
the	null
readers	null
memory	null
at	null
all	null
for	null
the	null
tale	null
of	null
Gabriel	null
Grubb	null
is	null
grotesque	null
rather	null
than	null
horrible	null
and	null
the	null
two	null
gloomy	null
stories	null
of	null
the	null
Madman	null
and	null
the	null
Queer	null
Client	null
are	null
so	null
utterly	null
irrelevant	null
to	null
the	null
tale	null
that	null
even	null
if	null
the	null
reader	null
remember	null
them	null
he	null
probably	null
does	null
not	null
remember	null
that	null
they	null
occur	null
in	null
Pickwick	null
Critics	null
have	null
complained	null
of	null
Shakespeare	null
and	null
others	null
for	null
putting	null
comic	null
episodes	null
into	null
a	null
tragedy	null
It	null
required	null
a	null
man	null
with	null
the	null
courage	null
and	null
coarseness	null
of	null
Dickens	null
actually	null
to	null
put	null
tragic	null
episodes	null
into	null
a	null
farce	null
But	null
they	null
are	null
not	null
caught	null
up	null
into	null
the	null
story	null
at	null
all	null
In	null
Oliver	null
Twist	null
however	null
the	null
thing	null
broke	null
out	null
with	null
an	null
almost	null
brutal	null
inspiration	null
and	null
those	null
who	null
had	null
fallen	null
in	null
love	null
with	null
Dickens	null
for	null
his	null
generous	null
buffoonery	null
may	null
very	null
likely	null
have	null
been	null
startled	null
at	null
receiving	null
such	null
very	null
different	null
fare	null
at	null
the	null
next	null
helping	null
When	null
you	null
have	null
bought	null
a	null
mans	null
book	null
because	null
you	null
like	null
his	null
writing	null
about	null
Mr	null
Wardles	null
punchbowl	null
and	null
Mr	null
Winkles	null
skates	null
it	null
may	null
very	null
well	null
be	null
surprising	null
to	null
open	null
it	null
and	null
read	null
about	null
the	null
sickening	null
thuds	null
that	null
beat	null
out	null
the	null
life	null
of	null
Nancy	null
or	null
that	null
mysterious	null
villain	null
whose	null
face	null
was	null
blasted	null
with	null
disease	null
If	null
there	null
was	null
any	null
such	null
disappointment	null
it	null
has	null
left	null
no	null
mark	null
in	null
history	null
for	null
after	null
Oliver	null
Twist	null
as	null
after	null
Pickwick	null
Dickenscareer	null
continued	null
to	null
be	null
a	null
triumphal	null
procession	null
But	null
for	null
the	null
critic	null
in	null
our	null
own	null
time	null
at	null
any	null
rate	null
the	null
first	null
great	null
element	null
in	null
the	null
book	null
is	null
this	null
first	null
revelation	null
of	null
Dickenspower	null
over	null
the	null
ghastly	null
and	null
the	null
unnatural	null
For	null
this	null
specific	null
and	null
narrow	null
purpose	null
the	null
work	null
is	null
really	null
admirable	null
Characters	null
which	null
are	null
not	null
very	null
clearly	null
conceived	null
as	null
regards	null
their	null
own	null
psychology	null
are	null
yet	null
at	null
certain	null
moments	null
managed	null
so	null
as	null
to	null
shake	null
to	null
its	null
foundations	null
our	null
own	null
psychology	null
Bill	null
Sikes	null
is	null
not	null
exactly	null
a	null
real	null
man	null
but	null
for	null
all	null
that	null
he	null
is	null
a	null
real	null
murderer	null
Nancy	null
is	null
not	null
really	null
impressive	null
as	null
a	null
living	null
woman	null
but	null
as	null
the	null
phrase	null
goes	null
she	null
makes	null
a	null
lovely	null
corpse	null
Something	null
quite	null
childish	null
and	null
eternal	null
in	null
us	null
something	null
which	null
is	null
shocked	null
with	null
the	null
mere	null
simplicity	null
of	null
death	null
quivers	null
when	null
we	null
read	null
of	null
those	null
repeated	null
blows	null
or	null

cursing	null
the	null
telltale	null
cur	null
who	null
will	null
X	null
Introduction	null
follow	null
his	null
bloody	null
footprints	null
And	null
this	null
curious	null
sublime	null
melodrama	null
which	null
is	null
melodrama	null
and	null
yet	null
is	null
painfully	null
real	null
reaches	null
its	null
hideous	null
height	null
in	null
that	null
fine	null
scene	null
of	null
the	null
death	null
of	null
Sikes	null
the	null
besieged	null

the	null

the	null
early	null
eighteenth	null
century	null
It	null
is	null
not	null
easy	null
to	null
define	null
this	null
Hogarthian	null
quality	null
in	null
words	null
beyond	null
saying	null
that	null
it	null
is	null
a	null
sort	null
of	null
alphabetical	null
realism	null
like	null
the	null
cruel	null
candour	null
of	null
children	null
But	null
it	null
has	null
about	null
it	null
these	null
two	null
special	null
principles	null
which	null
separate	null
it	null
from	null
all	null
that	null
we	null
call	null
realism	null
in	null
our	null
time	null
First	null
that	null
with	null
us	null
a	null
moral	null
story	null
means	null
a	null
story	null
about	null
moral	null
people	null
with	null
them	null
a	null
moral	null
story	null
meant	null
more	null
often	null
a	null
story	null
about	null
immoral	null
people	null
Second	null
that	null
with	null
us	null
realism	null
is	null
always	null
associated	null
with	null
some	null
subtle	null
view	null
of	null
morals	null
with	null
them	null
realism	null
was	null
always	null
associated	null
with	null
some	null
simple	null
view	null
of	null
morals	null
The	null
end	null
of	null
Bill	null
Sikes	null
exactly	null
in	null
the	null
way	null
that	null
the	null
law	null
would	null
have	null
killed	null
him	null
—	null
this	null
is	null
a	null
Hogarthian	null
incident	null
it	null
carries	null
on	null
that	null
tradition	null
of	null
startling	null
and	null
shocking	null
platitude	null
All	null
this	null
element	null
in	null
the	null
book	null
was	null
a	null
sincere	null
thing	null
in	null
the	null
author	null
but	null
none	null
the	null
less	null
it	null
came	null
from	null
old	null
soils	null
from	null
the	null
graveyard	null
and	null
the	null
gallows	null
and	null
the	null
lane	null
where	null
the	null
ghost	null
walked	null
Dickens	null
was	null
always	null
attracted	null
to	null
such	null
things	null
and	null
as	null
Forster	null
says	null
with	null
inimitable	null
simplicity	null
but	null
for	null
his	null
strong	null
sense	null
might	null
have	null
fallen	null
into	null
the	null
follies	null
of	null
spiritualism	null
As	null
a	null
matter	null
of	null
fact	null
like	null
most	null
of	null
the	null
men	null
of	null
strong	null
sense	null
in	null
his	null
tradition	null
Dickens	null
was	null
left	null
with	null
a	null
half	null
belief	null
in	null
spirits	null
which	null
became	null
in	null
practice	null
a	null
belief	null
in	null
bad	null
spirits	null
The	null
great	null
disadvantage	null
of	null
those	null
who	null
have	null
too	null
much	null
strong	null
sense	null
to	null
believe	null
in	null
spiritualism	null
is	null
that	null
they	null
keep	null
last	null
the	null
low	null
and	null
little	null
forms	null
of	null
the	null
supernatural	null
such	null
as	null
omens	null
curses	null
spectres	null
and	null
retributions	null
but	null
find	null
a	null
high	null
and	null
happy	null
supernaturalism	null
quite	null
incredible	null
Thus	null
the	null
Puritans	null
denied	null
the	null
sacraments	null
but	null
went	null
on	null
burning	null
witches	null
This	null
shadow	null
does	null
rest	null
to	null
some	null
extent	null
upon	null
the	null
rational	null
English	null
writers	null
like	null
Dicktas	null
supernaturalism	null
was	null
dying	null
but	null
its	null
ugliest	null
roots	null
died	null
last	null
Dickens	null
would	null
have	null
found	null
it	null
easier	null
to	null
believe	null
in	null
a	null
ghost	null
than	null
in	null
a	null
vision	null
of	null
the	null
Virgin	null
with	null
angels	null
There	null
for	null
good	null
or	null
evil	null
however	null
was	null
the	null
root	null
of	null
the	null
old	null
diablerie	null
in	null
Dickens	null
and	null
there	null
it	null
is	null
in	null
Introduction	null
xi	null
Oliver	null
Twist	null
But	null
this	null
was	null
only	null
the	null
first	null
of	null
the	null
newDickens	null
elements	null
which	null
must	null
have	null
surprised	null
those	null
Dickensians	null
who	null
eagerly	null
bought	null
his	null
second	null
book	null
The	null
second	null
of	null
the	null
new	null
Dickens	null
elements	null
is	null
equally	null
indisputable	null
and	null
separate	null
It	null
swelled	null
afterwards	null
to	null
enormous	null
proportions	null
in	null
Dickenswork	null
but	null
it	null
really	null
has	null
its	null
rise	null
here	null
Again	null
as	null
in	null
the	null
case	null
of	null
the	null
element	null
of	null
diablerie	null
it	null
would	null
be	null
possible	null
to	null
make	null
technical	null
exceptions	null
in	null
favour	null
of	null
Pickwick	null
Just	null
as	null
there	null
were	null
quite	null
inappropriate	null
scraps	null
of	null
the	null
gruesome	null
element	null
in	null
Pickwick	null
so	null
there	null
are	null
quite	null
inappropriate	null
allusions	null
to	null
this	null
other	null
topic	null
in	null
Pickwick	null
But	null
nobody	null
by	null
merely	null
reading	null
Pickwick	null
would	null
even	null
remember	null
this	null
topic	null
no	null
one	null
by	null
merely	null
reading	null
Pickwick	null
would	null
know	null
what	null
this	null
topic	null
is	null
this	null
third	null
great	null
subject	null
of	null
Dickens	null
this	null
second	null
great	null
subject	null
of	null
the	null
Dickens	null
of	null
Oliver	null
Twist	null
This	null
subject	null
is	null
social	null
oppression	null
It	null
is	null
surely	null
fair	null
to	null
say	null
that	null
no	null
one	null
could	null
have	null
gathered	null
from	null
Pickwick	null
how	null
this	null
question	null
boiled	null
in	null
the	null
blood	null
of	null
the	null
author	null
of	null
Pickwick	null
There	null
are	null
indeed	null
passages	null
particularly	null
in	null
connection	null
with	null
Mr	null
Pickwick	null
in	null
the	null
debtors	null
prison	null
which	null
prove	null
to	null
us	null
looking	null
back	null
on	null
a	null
whole	null
public	null
career	null
that	null
Dickens	null
had	null
been	null
from	null
the	null
beginning	null
bitter	null
and	null
bold	null
about	null
the	null
problem	null
of	null
our	null
civilisation	null
No	null
one	null
could	null
have	null
imagined	null
at	null
the	null
time	null
that	null
this	null
bitterness	null
ran	null
in	null
an	null
unbroken	null
river	null
under	null
all	null
the	null
surges	null
of	null
that	null
superb	null
gaiety	null
and	null
exuberance	null
With	null
Oliver	null
Twist	null
this	null
sterner	null
side	null
of	null
Dickens	null
was	null
suddenly	null
revealed	null
For	null
the	null
very	null
first	null
pages	null
of	null
Oliver	null
Twist	null
are	null
stern	null
even	null
when	null
they	null
are	null
funny	null
They	null
amuse	null
but	null
they	null
cannot	null
be	null
enjoyed	null
as	null
can	null
the	null
passages	null
about	null
the	null
follies	null
of	null
Mr	null
Snodgrass	null
or	null
the	null
humiliations	null
of	null
Mr	null
Winkle	null
The	null
difference	null
between	null
the	null
old	null
easy	null
humour	null
and	null
this	null
new	null
harsh	null
humour	null
is	null
a	null
difference	null
not	null
of	null
degree	null
but	null
of	null
kind	null
Dickens	null
makes	null
game	null
of	null
Mr	null
Bumble	null
because	null
he	null
wants	null
to	null
kill	null
Mr	null
Bumble	null
he	null
made	null
game	null
of	null
Mr	null
Winkle	null
because	null
he	null
wanted	null
him	null
to	null
live	null
for	null
ever	null
Dickens	null
has	null
taken	null
the	null
sword	null
in	null
hand	null
against	null
what	null
is	null
he	null
declaring	null
war	null
It	null
is	null
just	null
here	null
that	null
the	null
greatness	null
of	null
Dickens	null
comes	null
in	null
it	null
is	null
just	null
here	null
that	null
the	null
difference	null
lies	null
between	null
the	null
pedant	null
and	null
the	null
poet	null
Dickens	null
enters	null
the	null
social	null
and	null
political	null
war	null
and	null
the	null
first	null
stroke	null
he	null
deals	null
is	null
not	null
only	null
significant	null
but	null
even	null
startling	null
Fully	null
to	null
see	null
this	null
we	null
must	null
appreciate	null
the	null
national	null
situation	null
It	null
was	null
an	null
age	null
of	null
reform	null
and	null
even	null
of	null
radical	null
reform	null
the	null
world	null
was	null
full	null
of	null
radicals	null
and	null
reformers	null
but	null
only	null
too	null
many	null
xii	null
Introduction	null
of	null
them	null
took	null
the	null
line	null
of	null
attacking	null
everything	null
and	null
anything	null
that	null
was	null
opposed	null
to	null
some	null
particular	null
theory	null
among	null
the	null
many	null
political	null
theories	null
that	null
possessed	null
the	null
end	null
of	null
the	null
eighteenth	null
century	null
Some	null
had	null
so	null
much	null
perfected	null
the	null
perfect	null
theory	null
of	null
republicanism	null
that	null
they	null
almost	null
lay	null
awake	null
at	null
night	null
because	null
Queen	null
Victoria	null
had	null
a	null
crown	null
on	null
her	null
head	null
Others	null
were	null
so	null
certain	null
that	null
mankind	null
had	null
hitherto	null
been	null
merely	null
strangled	null
in	null
the	null
bonds	null
of	null
the	null
State	null
that	null
they	null
saw	null
truth	null
only	null
in	null
the	null
destruction	null
of	null
tariffs	null
or	null
of	null
byelaws	null
The	null
greater	null
part	null
of	null
that	null
generation	null
held	null
that	null
clearness	null
economy	null
and	null
a	null
hard	null
commonsense	null
would	null
soon	null
destroy	null
the	null
errors	null
that	null
had	null
been	null
erected	null
by	null
the	null
superstitions	null
and	null
sentimentalities	null
of	null
the	null
past	null
In	null
pursuance	null
of	null
this	null
idea	null
many	null
of	null
the	null
new	null
men	null
of	null
the	null
new	null
century	null
quite	null
confident	null
that	null
they	null
were	null
invigorating	null
the	null
new	null
age	null
sought	null
to	null
destroy	null
the	null
old	null
sentimental	null
clericalism	null
the	null
old	null
sentimental	null
feudalism	null
the	null
oldworld	null
belief	null
in	null
priests	null
the	null
oldworld	null
belief	null
in	null
patrons	null
and	null
among	null
other	null
things	null
the	null
oldworld	null
belief	null
in	null
beggars	null
They	null
sought	null
among	null
other	null
things	null
to	null
clear	null
away	null
the	null
old	null
visionary	null
kindliness	null
on	null
the	null
subject	null
of	null
vagrants	null
Hence	null
those	null
reformers	null
enacted	null
not	null
only	null
a	null
new	null
reform	null
law	null
but	null
also	null
a	null
new	null
poor	null
law	null
In	null
creating	null
many	null
other	null
modern	null
things	null
they	null
created	null
the	null
modern	null
workhouse	null
and	null
when	null
Dickens	null
came	null
out	null
to	null
fight	null
it	null
was	null
the	null
first	null
thing	null
that	null
he	null
broke	null
with	null
his	null
battleaxe	null
This	null
is	null
where	null
Dickenssocial	null
revolt	null
is	null
of	null
more	null
value	null
than	null
mere	null
politics	null
and	null
avoids	null
the	null
vulgarity	null
of	null
the	null
novel	null
with	null
a	null
purpose	null
His	null
revolt	null
is	null
not	null
a	null
revolt	null
of	null
the	null
commercialist	null
against	null
the	null
feudalist	null
of	null
the	null
Nonconformist	null
against	null
the	null
Churchman	null
of	null
the	null
Freetrader	null
against	null
the	null
Protectionist	null
of	null
the	null
Liberal	null
against	null
the	null
Tory	null
If	null
he	null
were	null
among	null
us	null
now	null
his	null
revolt	null
would	null
not	null
be	null
the	null
revolt	null
of	null
the	null
Socialist	null
against	null
the	null
Individualist	null
or	null
of	null
the	null
Anarchist	null
against	null
the	null
Socialist	null
His	null
revolt	null
was	null
simply	null
and	null
solely	null
the	null
eternal	null
revolt	null
it	null
was	null
the	null
revolt	null
of	null
the	null
weak	null
against	null
the	null
strong	null
He	null
did	null
not	null
dislike	null
this	null
or	null
that	null
argument	null
for	null
oppression	null
he	null
disliked	null
oppression	null
Me	null
disliked	null
a	null
certain	null
look	null
on	null
the	null
face	null
of	null
a	null
man	null
when	null
he	null
looks	null
down	null
on	null
another	null
man	null
And	null
that	null
look	null
on	null
that	null
face	null
is	null
the	null
only	null
thing	null
in	null
the	null
world	null
that	null
we	null
have	null
really	null
to	null
fight	null
between	null
here	null
and	null
the	null
fires	null
of	null
Hell	null
That	null
which	null
pedants	null
of	null
that	null
time	null
and	null
this	null
time	null
would	null
have	null
called	null
the	null
sentimentalism	null
of	null
Dickens	null
was	null
really	null
simply	null
the	null
detached	null
sanity	null
of	null
Dickens	null
He	null
cared	null
nothing	null
for	null
the	null
fugitive	null
explanations	null
of	null
the	null
Constitutional	null
Conservatives	null
he	null
cared	null
nothing	null
for	null
the	null
fugitive	null
explanations	null
of	null
Introduction	null
xiii	null
the	null
Manchester	null
School	null
He	null
would	null
have	null
cared	null
quite	null
as	null
little	null
for	null
the	null
fugitive	null
explanations	null
of	null
the	null
Fabian	null
Society	null
or	null
of	null
the	null
modern	null
scientific	null
Socialist	null
He	null
saw	null
that	null
under	null
many	null
forms	null
there	null
was	null
one	null
fact	null
the	null
tyranny	null
of	null
man	null
over	null
man	null
and	null
he	null
struck	null
at	null
it	null
when	null
he	null
saw	null
it	null
whether	null
it	null
was	null
old	null
or	null
new	null
When	null
he	null
found	null
that	null
footmen	null
and	null
rustics	null
were	null
too	null
much	null
afraid	null
of	null
Sir	null
Leicester	null
Dedlock	null
he	null
attacked	null
Sir	null
Leicester	null
Dedlock	null
he	null
did	null
not	null
carewhether	null
Sir	null
Leicester	null
Dedlock	null
said	null
he	null
was	null
attacking	null
England	null
or	null
whether	null
Mr	null
Rouncewell	null
the	null
Ironmaster	null
said	null
he	null
was	null
attacking	null
an	null
effete	null
oligarchy	null
In	null
that	null
case	null
he	null
pleased	null
Mr	null
Rouncewell	null
the	null
Ironmaster	null
and	null
displeased	null
Sir	null
Leicester	null
Dedlock	null
the	null
Aristocrat	null
But	null
when	null
he	null
found	null
that	null
Mr	null
Rouncewells	null
workmen	null
were	null
much	null
too	null
frightened	null
of	null
Mr	null
Rouncewell	null
then	null
he	null
displeased	null
Mr	null
Rouncewell	null
in	null
turn	null
he	null
displeased	null
Mr	null
Rouncewell	null
very	null
much	null
by	null
calling	null
him	null
Mr	null
Bounderby	null
When	null
he	null
imagined	null
himself	null
to	null
be	null
fighting	null
old	null
laws	null
he	null
gave	null
a	null
sort	null
of	null
vague	null
and	null
general	null
approval	null
to	null
new	null
laws	null
But	null
when	null
he	null
came	null
to	null
the	null
new	null
laws	null
they	null
had	null
a	null
bad	null
time	null
When	null
Dickens	null
found	null
that	null
after	null
a	null
hundred	null
economic	null
arguments	null
and	null
granting	null
a	null
hundred	null
economic	null
considerations	null
the	null
fact	null
remained	null
that	null
paupers	null
in	null
modern	null
workhouses	null
were	null
much	null
too	null
afraid	null
of	null
the	null
beadle	null
just	null
as	null
vassals	null
in	null
ancient	null
castles	null
were	null
much	null
too	null
afraid	null
of	null
the	null
Dedlocks	null
then	null
he	null
struck	null
suddenly	null
and	null
at	null
once	null
This	null
is	null
what	null
makes	null
the	null
opening	null
chapters	null
of	null
Oliver	null
Twist	null
so	null
curious	null
and	null
important	null
The	null
very	null
fact	null
of	null
Dickensdistance	null
from	null
and	null
independence	null
of	null
the	null
elaborate	null
financial	null
arguments	null
of	null
his	null
time	null
makes	null
more	null
definite	null
and	null
dazzling	null
his	null
sudden	null
assertion	null
that	null
he	null
sees	null
the	null
old	null
human	null
tyranny	null
in	null
front	null
of	null
him	null
as	null
plain	null
as	null
the	null
sun	null
at	null
noonday	null
Dickens	null
attacks	null
the	null
modern	null
workhouse	null
with	null
a	null
sort	null
of	null
inspired	null
simplicity	null
as	null
of	null
a	null
boy	null
in	null
a	null
fairy	null
tale	null
who	null
had	null
wandered	null
about	null
sword	null
in	null
hand	null
looking	null
for	null
ogres	null
and	null
who	null
had	null
found	null
an	null
indisputable	null
ogre	null
All	null
the	null
other	null
people	null
of	null
his	null
time	null
are	null
attacking	null
things	null
because	null
they	null
are	null

are	null

is	null
attacking	null

which	null

Oliver	null
Twist	null
enters	null
it	null
as	null
a	null
little	null
child	null
This	null
is	null
the	null
real	null
power	null
and	null
pathos	null
of	null
that	null
celebrated	null
passage	null
in	null
the	null
book	null
which	null
has	null
passed	null
into	null
a	null
proverb	null
but	null
which	null

its	null
terrible	null
humour	null
even	null
in	null
being	null
hackneyed	null
T	null
mean	null
of	null
course	null
the	null
everlasting	null
quotation	null
about	null
Oliver	null
Twist	null
asking	null
for	null
more	null
The	null
real	null
poignancy	null
that	null
there	null
is	null
in	null
this	null
idea	null
is	null
a	null
very	null
good	null
study	null
in	null
that	null
strong	null
school	null
of	null
social	null
criticism	null
which	null
Dickens	null
represented	null
A	null
modern	null
realist	null
describing	null
the	null
dreary	null
workhouse	null
would	null
have	null
made	null
all	null
the	null
children	null
utterly	null
crushed	null
not	null
daring	null
to	null
speak	null
at	null
all	null
not	null
expecting	null
anything	null
not	null
hoping	null
anything	null
past	null
all	null
possibility	null
of	null
affording	null
even	null
an	null
ironical	null
contrast	null
or	null
a	null
protest	null
of	null
despair	null
A	null
modern	null
in	null
short	null
would	null
have	null
made	null
all	null
the	null
boys	null
in	null
the	null
workhouse	null
pathetic	null
by	null
making	null
them	null
all	null
pessimists	null
But	null
Oliver	null
Twist	null
is	null
not	null
pathetic	null
because	null
he	null
is	null
a	null
pessimist	null
Oliver	null
Twist	null
is	null
pathetic	null
because	null
he	null
is	null
an	null
optimist	null
The	null
whole	null
tragedy	null
of	null
that	null
incident	null
is	null
in	null
the	null
fact	null
that	null
he	null
does	null
expect	null
the	null
universe	null
to	null
be	null
kind	null
to	null
him	null
that	null
he	null
does	null
believe	null
that	null
he	null
is	null
living	null
in	null
a	null
just	null
world	null
He	null
comes	null
before	null
the	null
Guardians	null
as	null
the	null
ragged	null
peasants	null
of	null
the	null
French	null
Revolution	null
came	null
before	null
the	null
Kings	null
and	null
Parliaments	null
of	null
Europe	null
That	null
is	null
to	null
say	null
he	null
comes	null
indeed	null
with	null
gloomy	null
experiences	null
but	null
he	null
comes	null
with	null
a	null
happy	null
philosophy	null
He	null
knows	null
that	null
there	null
are	null
wrongs	null
of	null
man	null
to	null
be	null
cursed	null
but	null
he	null
believes	null
also	null
that	null
there	null
are	null
rights	null
of	null
man	null
to	null
be	null
demanded	null
It	null
has	null
often	null
been	null
remarked	null
as	null
a	null
singular	null
fact	null
that	null
the	null
French	null
poor	null
who	null
stand	null
in	null
historic	null
tradition	null
as	null
typical	null
of	null
all	null
the	null
desperate	null
men	null
who	null
have	null
dragged	null
down	null
tyranny	null
were	null
as	null
a	null
matter	null
of	null
fact	null
by	null
no	null
means	null
worse	null
off	null
than	null
the	null
poor	null
of	null
many	null
other	null
European	null
countries	null
before	null
the	null
Revolution	null
The	null
truth	null
is	null
that	null
the	null
French	null
were	null
tragic	null
because	null
they	null
were	null
better	null
off	null
The	null
others	null
had	null
known	null
the	null
sorrowful	null
experiences	null
but	null
they	null
alone	null
had	null
known	null
the	null
splendid	null
expectation	null
and	null
the	null
original	null
claims	null
It	null
was	null
just	null
here	null
that	null
Dickens	null
was	null
so	null
true	null
a	null
child	null
of	null
them	null
and	null
of	null
their	null
happy	null
theory	null
so	null
bitterly	null
applied	null
They	null
were	null
the	null
one	null
oppressed	null
people	null
that	null
innocently	null
asked	null
for	null
justice	null
they	null
were	null

PREFACE	null
Once	null
upon	null
a	null
time	null
it	null
was	null
held	null
to	null
be	null
a	null
coarse	null
and	null
shocking	null
circumstance	null
that	null
some	null
of	null
the	null
characters	null
in	null
these	null
pages	null
are	null
chosen	null
from	null
the	null
most	null
criminal	null
and	null
degraded	null
of	null
Londons	null
population	null
As	null
I	null
saw	null
no	null
reason	null
when	null
I	null
wrote	null
this	null
book	null
why	null
the	null
dregs	null
of	null
life	null
so	null
long	null
as	null
their	null
speech	null
did	null
not	null
offend	null
the	null
ear	null
should	null
not	null
serve	null
the	null
purpose	null
of	null
a	null
moral	null
as	null
well	null
as	null
its	null
froth	null
and	null
cream	null
I	null
made	null
bold	null
to	null
believe	null
that	null
this	null
same	null
Once	null
upon	null
a	null
time	null
would	null
not	null
prove	null
to	null
be	null
Alltime	null
or	null
even	null
a	null
long	null
time	null
I	null
saw	null
many	null
strong	null
reasons	null
for	null
pursuing	null
my	null
course	null
I	null
had	null
read	null
of	null
thieves	null
by	null
scores	null
j	null
seductive	null
fellows	null
amiable	null
for	null
the	null
most	null
part	null
faultless	null
in	null
dress	null
plump	null
in	null
pocket	null
choice	null
in	null
horseflesh	null
bold	null
in	null
bearing	null
fortunate	null
in	null
gallantry	null
great	null
at	null
a	null
song	null
a	null
bottle	null
pack	null
of	null
cards	null
or	null
dicebox	null
and	null
fit	null
companions	null
for	null
the	null
bravest	null
But	null
I	null
had	null
never	null
met	null
except	null
in	null
Hogarth	null
with	null
the	null
miserable	null
reality	null
It	null
appeared	null
to	null
me	null
that	null
to	null
draw	null
a	null
knot	null
of	null
such	null
associates	null
in	null
crime	null
as	null
really	null
did	null
exist	null
to	null
paint	null
them	null
in	null
all	null
their	null
deformity	null
in	null
all	null
their	null
wretchedness	null
in	null
all	null
the	null
squalid	null
misery	null
of	null
their	null
lives	null
to	null
show	null
them	null
as	null
they	null
really	null
were	null
for	null
ever	null
skulking	null
uneasily	null
through	null
the	null
dirtiest	null
paths	null
of	null
life	null
with	null
the	null
great	null
black	null
ghastly	null
gallows	null
closing	null
up	null
their	null
prospect	null
turn	null
them	null
where	null
they	null
might	null
it	null
appeared	null
to	null
me	null
that	null
to	null
do	null
this	null
would	null
be	null
to	null
attempt	null
a	null
something	null
which	null
was	null
needed	null
and	null
which	null
would	null
be	null
a	null
service	null
to	null
society	null
And	null
I	null
did	null
it	null
as	null
I	null
best	null
could	null
In	null
every	null
book	null
I	null
know	null
where	null
such	null
characters	null
are	null
treated	null
of	null
allurements	null
and	null
fascinations	null
are	null
thrown	null
around	null
them	null
Even	null
in	null
the	null
Beggars	null
Opera	null
the	null
thieves	null
are	null
represented	null
as	null
leading	null
a	null
life	null
which	null
is	null
rather	null
to	null
be	null
envied	null
than	null
otherwise	null
while	null
Macheath	null
with	null
all	null
the	null
captivations	null
of	null
command	null
and	null
the	null
devotion	null
of	null
the	null
most	null
beautiful	null
girl	null
and	null
only	null
pure	null
character	null
in	null
the	null
piece	null
is	null
as	null
much	null
to	null
be	null
admired	null
and	null
emulated	null
by	null
weak	null
beholders	null
as	null
any	null
fine	null
gentleman	null

has	null
purchased	null

says	null

right	null

any	null

will	null

Macheath	null
is	null
reprieved	null
seems	null
to	null
me	null
beside	null
the	null
matter	null
I	null
ask	null
myself	null
whether	null
any	null
man	null
will	null
be	null
deterred	null
from	null
turning	null
thief	null
because	null
of	null
Macheaths	null
being	null
sentenced	null
to	null
death	null
and	null
because	null
of	null
the	null
existence	null
of	null
Peachum	null

of	null
London	null
the	null

that	null

instinctively	null

Mrs	null
Massaroni	null
being	null
a	null
lady	null
in	null

thing	null
to	null

a	null
Nancy	null
being	null
a	null
creature	null
in	null
a	null
cotton	null

is	null
not	null

how	null
Virtue	null

there	null

some	null
