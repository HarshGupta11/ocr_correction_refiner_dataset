INTRODUCTION	null
Upon	null
any	null
disparities	null
between	null
Emma	null
and	null
its	null
immediate	null
predecessor	null
Miss	null
Austen	null
must	null
have	null
derived	null
but	null
scant	null
enlightenment	null
from	null
the	null
notice	null
in	null
the	null
Quarterly	null
which	null
by	null
some	null
mischance	null
while	null
professing	null
to	null
summarise	null
her	null
former	null
novels	null
is	null
absolutely	null
silent	null
as	null
to	null
Mansfield	null
Park	null
Of	null
the	null
story	null
of	null
Emma	null
it	null
gives	null
a	null
sufficient	null
report	null
and	null
an	null
extract	null
of	null
considerable	null
length	null
in	null
illustration	null
of	null
Mr	null
Woodhouses	null
peculiarities	null
The	null
merits	null
of	null
the	null
author	null
are	null
declared	null
to	null
consist	null
in	null
the	null
neatness	null
and	null
point	null
of	null
the	null
narrative	null
and	null
the	null
quiet	null
comedy	null
of	null
the	null
dialoguein	null
which	null
the	null
characters	null
of	null
the	null
speakers	null
evolve	null
themselves	null
with	null
dramatic	null
effect	null
while	null
the	null
faults	null
are	null
said	null
to	null
lie	null
in	null
the	null
minute	null
detail	null
of	null
the	null
plan	null
and	null
in	null
a	null
certain	null
tedium	null
in	null
the	null
presentment	null
of	null
such	null
characters	null
of	null
folly	null
and	null
simplicityas	null
Mr	null
Woodhouse	null
and	null
Miss	null
Bates	null
This	null
latter	null
deliverance	null
as	null
may	null
well	null
be	null
imagined	null
gave	null
but	null
qualified	null
satisfaction	null
to	null
Miss	null
Austens	null
first	null
biographer	null
Mr	null
Austen	null
Leigh	null
nor	null
was	null
it	null
to	null
the	null
taste	null
of	null
her	null
next	null
critic	null
Dr	null
Whately	null
who	null
five	null
years	null
later	null
in	null
the	null
same	null
periodical	null
traversed	null
both	null
these	null
propositions	null
besides	null
devoting	null
several	null
pages	null
to	null
special	null
examination	null
of	null
the	null
neglected	null
beauties	null
of	null
Mansfield	null
Park	null
Miss	null
Austens	null
minuteness	null
Dr	null
Whately	null
argues	null
even	null
if	null
it	null
can	null
be	null
characterised	null
as	null
tedious	null
is	null
essential	null
to	null
that	null
complete	null
acquaintance	null
with	null
her	null
characters	null
which	null
is	null
necessary	null
to	null
interest	null
the	null
reader	null
in	null
them	null
and	null
in	null
regard	null
to	null
the	null
strictures	null
which	null
his	null
forerunner	null
makes	null
upon	null
her	null
fools	null
he	null
roundly	null
maintains	null
that	null
it	null
requires	null
more	null
genius	null
to	null
paint	null
a	null
fool	null
than	null
a	null
person	null
of	null
sense	null
—that	null
to	null
the	null
eye	null
of	null
a	null
skilful	null
naturalist	null
the	null
insects	null
on	null
a	null
leaf	null
present	null
as	null
wide	null
differences	null
as	null
exist	null
between	null
the	null
elephant	null
and	null
the	null
lion—	null
and	null
that	null
the	null
critics	null
who	null
find	null
Miss	null
Austens	null
fools	null
too	null
like	null
nature	null
must	null
whatever	null
deference	null
they	null
may	null
outwardly	null
pay	null
to	null
received	null
opinions	null
also	null
find	null
Twelfth	null
Night	null
and	null
the	null
Merry	null
Wives	null
of	null
Windsor	null
exceedingly	null
ix	null
EMMA	null
tiresome	null
In	null
this	null
and	null
in	null
other	null
parts	null
of	null
his	null
paper	null
which	null
unhappily	null
was	null
not	null
published	null
until	null
after	null
Miss	null
Austens	null
death	null
Dr	null
Whately	null
struck	null
the	null
note	null
of	null
subsequent	null
criticism	null
by	null
which	null
with	null
more	null
or	null
less	null
emphasis	null
these	null
opinions	null
have	null
been	null
reasserted	null
—	null
the	null
comparison	null
with	null
Shakespeare	null
not	null
omittedThe	null
hand	null
which	null
drew	null
Miss	null
Bates	null
though	null
it	null
could	null
not	null
have	null
drawn	null
Lady	null
Macbeth	null
could	null
have	null
drawn	null
Dame	null
Quickly	null
or	null
the	null
nurse	null
in	null
Romeo	null
and	null
Juliet	null
So	null
says	null
Mr	null
Austen	null
Leighs	null
latest	null
successor	null
Prof	null
Gold	null
win	null
Smith	null
Yet	null
a	null
genuine	null
admirer	null
may	null
perhaps	null
allow	null
that	null
some	null
of	null
the	null
excellent	null
Miss	null
Batess	null
speeches	null
even	null
though	null
they	null
should	null
be	null
taken	null
by	null
the	null
reader	null
in	null
doublequick	null
time	null
would	null
not	null
be	null
the	null
worse	null

This	null
however	null
is	null
the	null
solitary	null
concession	null
we	null
are	null
disposed	null
to	null
make	null
to	null
the	null
first	null
critic	null
of	null
Emma	null
whose	null
depressing	null
remarks	null
upon	null
its	null
humorous	null
personages	null
had	null
probably	null
their	null
baneful	null
effect	null
upon	null
the	null
humorous	null
personages	null
of	null
Persuasion	null
The	null
prolonged	null
interval	null
which	null
lies	null
between	null
the	null
composition	null
of	null
Mansfield	null
Park	null
and	null
Emma	null
and	null
the	null
composition	null
of	null
Miss	null
Austens	null
previously	null
published	null
novels	null
has	null
doubtless	null
prompted	null
the	null
discovery	null
of	null
a	null
difference	null
between	null
the	null
styles	null
of	null
the	null
earlier	null
and	null
later	null
work	null
—	null
a	null
difference	null
which	null
is	null
perhaps	null
more	null
expected	null
than	null
apparent	null
For	null
if	null
a	null
comparison	null
of	null
style	null
must	null
be	null
made	null
it	null
should	null
surely	null
be	null
between	null
the	null
books	null
last	null
written	null
and	null
Northanger	null
Abbey	null
rather	null
than	null
between	null
those	null
books	null
and	null
Pride	null
and	null
Prejudice	null
or	null
Sense	null
and	null
Sensibility	null
since	null
both	null
of	null
these	null
latter	null
were	null
revised	null
by	null
the	null
author	null
at	null
Chawton	null
while	null
Northanger	null
Abbey	null
was	null
printed	null
precisely	null
as	null
it	null
had	null
been	null
left	null
when	null
the	null
Bath	null
bookseller	null
buried	null
it	null
provisionally	null
in	null
his	null
drawer	null
But	null
without	null
refining	null
too	null
nicely	null
it	null
may	null
be	null
granted	null
that	null
the	null
Chawton	null
group	null
of	null
books	null
exhibit	null
just	null
that	null
progress	null
towards	null
perfection	null
which	null
should	null
be	null
expected	null
INTRODUCTION	null
when	null
we	null
contrast	null
the	null
efforts	null
of	null
a	null
clever	null
girl	null
in	null
her	null
teens	null
with	null
the	null
same	null
persons	null
productions	null
after	null
she	null
has	null
gained	null
experience	null
of	null
life	null
We	null
have	null
seen	null
that	null
Miss	null
Austen	null
herself	null
was	null
prepared	null
to	null
be	null
told	null
that	null
Emma	null
was	null
less	null
witty	null
than	null
Pride	null
and	null
Prejudice	null
and	null
it	null
is	null
manifest	null
that	null
there	null
is	null
a	null
prodigality	null
of	null
sparkle	null
in	null
the	null
one	null
which	null
is	null
—	null
at	null
least	null
—	null
subdued	null
in	null
the	null
other	null
In	null
Emma	null
indeed	null
Miss	null
Austen	null
appears	null
to	null
have	null
adopted	null
Mademoiselle	null
de	null
Lespinasses	null
motto	null
of	null
Rien	null
en	null
relief	null
With	null
the	null
exception	null
of	null
the	null
somewhat	null
laboured	null
outburst	null
in	null
Chapter	null
III	null
in	null
favour	null
of	null
the	null
oldfashioned	null
boardingschool	null
as	null
against	null
the	null
new	null
the	null
style	null
is	null
everywhere	null
carefully	null
subordinated	null
to	null
the	null
needs	null
of	null
the	null
narrative	null
while	null
the	null
slender	null
thread	null
of	null
the	null
intrigue	null
is	null
followed	null
with	null
the	null
closest	null
tenacity	null
The	null
heroine	null
at	null
first	null
is	null
scarcely	null
as	null
winning	null
as	null
some	null
of	null
her	null
predecessors	null
certainly	null
she	null
is	null
not	null
so	null
clever	null
I	null
am	null
going	null
to	null
take	null
a	null
heroine	null
whom	null
no	null
one	null
but	null
myself	null
will	null
much	null
likesaid	null
Emmas	null
creator	null
at	null
the	null
outset	null
and	null
in	null
part	null
she	null
was	null
right	null
for	null
Emmas	null
devices	null
to	null
alienate	null
Harriet	null
from	null
Robert	null
Martin	null
do	null
at	null
first	null
create	null
a	null
positive	null
prejudice	null
against	null
her	null
But	null
her	null
character	null
is	null
so	null
subtly	null
and	null
gradually	null
developed	null
that	null
by	null
the	null
time	null
she	null
has	null
come	null
to	null
see	null
the	null
errors	null
of	null
matchmaking	null
and	null
has	null
reached	null
the	null
luminous	null
moment	null
whenit	null
darted	null
through	null
her	null
with	null
the	null
speed	null
of	null
an	null
arrow	null
that	null
Mr	null
Knightley	null
must	null
marry	null
no	null
one	null
but	null
herselfwe	null
are	null
almost	null
prepared	null
to	null
forgive	null
her	null
for	null
being	null
rude	null
to	null
Miss	null
Bates	null
Whether	null
Mr	null
Knightley	null
really	null
made	null
an	null
ideal	null
husband	null
is	null
impossible	null
to	null
say	null
since	null
Miss	null
Austen	null
although	null
she	null
seems	null
to	null
have	null
vouchsafed	null
some	null
supplementary	null
particulars	null
to	null
her	null
family	null
respecting	null
Frank	null
Churchill	null
and	null
Jane	null
Fairfax	null
has	null
on	null
this	null
topic	null
preserved	null
a	null
discreet	null
silence	null
Lord	null
Brabourne	null
who	null
is	null
only	null
lukewarm	null
about	null
Emma	null
as	null
a	null
novel	null
is	null
distinctly	null
of	null
opinion	null
that	null
the	null
marriage	null
did	null
not	null
prove	null
a	null
success	null
But	null
he	null
is	null
unreasonably	null
EMMA	null
prejudiced	null
against	null
Mr	null
Knightley	null
who	null
he	null
says	null
interfered	null
too	null
muchPerhaps	null
he	null
does	null
but	null
he	null
loves	null
Emma	null
through	null
all	null
her	null
faults	null
and	null
all	null
his	null

Again	null
Lord	null

it	null

with	null
just	null
the	null
degree	null
of	null
admiration	null
which	null
Miss	null
Austen	null
herself	null
would	null
have	null
thought	null
sensible	null
and	null
suitable	null
Anything	null
like	null
warmth	null
or	null
enthusiasm	null
anything	null
energetic	null
poignant	null
heartfelt	null
is	null
utterly	null
out	null
of	null

in	null
commending	null
these	null

all	null
such	null
demonstration	null
the	null
authoress	null
would	null
have	null
met	null
with	null
a	null
wellbred	null
sneer	null
would	null
have	null
calmly	null
scorned	null
as	null
ouM	null
and	null

She	null

Even	null

no	null

than	null
an	null
occasional	null
graceful	null

distant	null
recognition	null
—	null
too	null
frequent	null
converse	null
with	null
them	null
would	null
ruffle	null
the	null
smooth	null
elegance	null

her	null

Her	null

What	null

it	null
suits	null
her	null
to	null

what	null

what	null
