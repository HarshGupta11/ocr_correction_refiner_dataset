generally	null
amply	null
sufficient	null
to	null
decide	null
matters	null
of	null
literary	null
rank	null
and	null
permanence	null
How	null
has	null
the	null

gone	null
in	null
the	null

Judging	null

written	null
and	null
read	null

years	null
by	null
the	null
common	null
verdict	null

to	null
the	null
Bront€	null
sbt	null
their	null

and	null
their	null
work	null
which	null
prevails	null
almost	null
without	null
ception	null
in	null
the	null
literary	null
criticism	null
of	null
the	null
present	null
day	null
by	null
tone	null
of	null
personal	null
tenderness	null
even	null
of	null
passionate	null
homage	null

many	null
wnt	null
speak	null
of	null

and	null

recognition	null
which	null
their	null
books	null
have	null
obtaii	null
I	null
X	null
JANE	null
EYRE	null
abroad	null
one	null
may	null
say	null
with	null
some	null
confidence	null
that	null
the	null
name	null
and	null
memory	null
of	null
the	null
Brontes	null
were	null
never	null
more	null
alive	null
than	null
now	null
that	null
Honour	null
and	null
Fame	null
have	null
got	null
about	null
their	null
gravesfor	null
good	null
and	null
all	null
and	null
that	null
Charlotte	null
and	null
Emily	null
Bronte	null
are	null
no	null
less	null
secure	null
at	null
any	null
rate	null
than	null
Jane	null
Austen	null
or	null
George	null
Eliot	null
or	null
Mrs	null
Browning	null
of	null
literary	null
recollection	null
in	null
the	null
time	null
to	null
come	null
But	null
if	null
the	null
Brontes	null
live	null
their	null
books	null
live	null
also	null
There	null
are	null
some	null
names	null
of	null
the	null
past	null
—	null
Byron	null
—	null
Voltaire	null
—	null
that	null
are	null
far	null
greater	null
now	null
more	null
full	null
of	null
magic	null
and	null
of	null
spell	null
than	null
the	null
books	null
associated	null
with	null
them	null
—	null
that	null
are	null
in	null
fact	null
separable	null
from	null
the	null
books	null
and	null
could	null
almost	null
live	null
on	null
without	null
them	null
But	null
Charlotte	null
Bronte	null
if	null
Jane	null
Eyre	null
and	null
Lucy	null
Snowe	null
You	null
cannot	null
think	null
of	null
her	null
apart	null
from	null
what	null
she	null
has	null
written	null
and	null
everything	null
that	null
she	null
wrote	null
has	null
the	null
challenging	null
quality	null
of	null
personal	null
emotion	null
or	null
of	null
passion	null
moving	null
in	null
a	null
narrow	null
range	null
among	null
very	null
concrete	null
things	null
and	null
intimately	null
fused	null
throughout	null
with	null
the	null
incidents	null
and	null
feelings	null
of	null
one	null
small	null
intense	null
experience	null
so	null
that	null
if	null
one	null
finds	null
as	null
one	null
does	null
find	null
abundantly	null
that	null
the	null
Brontes	null
are	null
remembered	null
it	null
must	null
be	null
that	null
their	null
books	null
arc	null

us	null
oppressed	null
by	null
poverty	null
and	null
by	null
daily	null
contact	null
with	null

she	null
describes	null
the	null
deaths	null
—	null
the	null
piteous	null
deaths—	null
of	null
two	null
of	null
the	null
sisters	null
in	null
the	null
very	null
moment	null
or	null
on	null
the	null
very	null
threshold	null
of	null
success	null
and	null
finally	null
her	null
narrative	null
brought	null
us	null
to	null
the	null
death	null
of	null
Charlotte	null
herself—	null
Charlotte	null
snatched	null
from	null
happiness	null
and	null
from	null
motherhood	null
after	null
one	null
brief	null
year	null
of	null
married	null
life	null
and	null
so	null
skilful	null
is	null
the	null
telling	null
so	null
touching	null
the	null
story	null
that	null
the	null
great	null
English	null
heart	null
goes	null
out	null
to	null
it	null
and	null
forthwith	null
the	null
Bront€	null
books	null
must	null
be	null
books	null
of	null
genius	null
because	null
the	null
BrontSs	null
are	null
so	null
interesting	null
and	null
their	null
story	null
so	null
tragic	null
Perhaps	null
this	null
explanation	null
is	null
put	null
forward	null
to	null
account	null
rathier	null
for	null
the	null
continuance	null
of	null
the	null
Bront€sfame	null
than	null
for	null
their	null
original	null
success	null
Such	null
a	null
critic	null
would	null
admit	null
thatJane	null
Eyra	null
is	null
at	null
least	null
a	null
vivid	null
and	null
exciting	null
story	null
thatVillettehas	null
at	null
least	null
passages	null
of	null
extraordinary	null
brilliance	null
but	null
he	null
will	null
obstinately	null
maintsun	null
none	null
the	null
less	null
that	null
other	null
books	null
now	null
foigotten	null
have	null
had	null
as	null
much	null
and	null
that	null
the	null
Bront€	null
Megendhas	null
unfairly	null
strengthened	null
the	null
claim	null
of	null
the	null
Bront€	null
stories	null
upon	null
posterity	null
Let	null
us	null
see	null
how	null
such	null
a	null
contention	null
stands	null
in	null
the	null
case	null

just	null

She	null

INTRODUCTION	null
that	null
London	null
people	null
talk	null
a	null
great	null
deal	null
of	null
writers	null
and	null
books	null
who	null
mean	null
nothing	null
in	null
the	null
country	null
nothing	null
to	null
England	null
at	null
large	null
As	null
to	null
the	null
shyness	null
it	null
was	null
the	null
torment	null
of	null
both	null
her	null
physical	null
and	null
mental	null
life	null
The	null
Celtic	null
craving	null
for	null
solitude	null
t	null
the	null
Celtic	null
shrinking	null
from	null
all	null
active	null
competitive	null
exbtence	null
—	null
they	null
were	null
part	null
of	null
Charlottes	null
inmost	null
nature	null
although	null
per	null
petually	null
crossed	null
and	null
checked	null
no	null
doubt	null
by	null
other	null
influences	null
driving	null
her	null
to	null
utterance	null
to	null
production	null
to	null
sustained	null
effort	null
And	null
for	null
endurance—	null
did	null
not	null
her	null
short	null
life	null
divided	null
between	null
labour	null
fame	null
and	null
calamity	null
make	null
first	null
and	null
chief	null
upon	null
all	null
who	null
knew	null
it	null
the	null
impression	null
of	null
an	null
unshaken	null
and	null
indomitable	null
spirit	null
The	null
chainless	null
soul	null
was	null
hers	null
no	null
less	null
than	null
Emilys	null
though	null
she	null
was	null
far	null
saner	null
and	null
sweeter	null
than	null
Emily	null
And	null
all	null
three	null
qualities	null
—	null
pride	null
shrinking	null
endurance	null
—	null

With	null

an	null
Jane	null

Snowe	null
They	null
supply	null
the	null
atmosphere	null
the	null
peculiar	null
note	null
of	null
all	null
the	null
stories	null
A	null
contempt	null
for	null
mean	null
and	null
easy	null
living	null
for	null
common	null
gains	null
and	null
common	null
luxuries	null
breathes	null
in	null
them	null
and	null
makes	null
them	null
harsh	null
and	null
bracing	null
as	null
the	null
air	null
of	null
her	null
own	null
moors	null
And	null
one	null
other	null
Celtic	null
quality	null
there	null
is	null
in	null
Charlotte	null
BrontS	null
and	null
her	null
books	null
which	null
is	null
responsible	null
perhaps	null
for	null
half	null
their	null
defects	null
It	null
b	null
a	null
quality	null
of	null
exuberance	null
of	null
extravagance	null

what	null

there	null

a	null
curious	null
vein	null

I	null

Reader	null
because	null
I	null
think	null
I	null
see	null
in	null
him	null
an	null
intellect	null
profounder	null
and	null
more	null
unique	null
than	null
his	null
contemporaries	null
have	null
yet	null
recognised	null
because	null
I	null
regard	null
him	null
as	null
the	null
first	null
social	null
regenerator	null
of	null
the	null
day	null
—	null
as	null
the	null
very	null
master	null
of	null
that	null
working	null
corps	null
who	null
would	null
restore	null
to	null
rectitude	null
the	null
warped	null
system	null
of	null
things	null
because	null
I	null
think	null
no	null
commentator	null
on	null
his	null
writings	null
has	null
yet	null
found	null
the	null
comparison	null
that	null
suits	null
him	null
the	null
terms	null
which	null
rightly	null
characterise	null
his	null
talent	null
They	null
say	null
he	null
is	null
like	null
Fielding	null
they	null
talk	null
of	null
his	null
wit	null
humour	null
comic	null
powers	null
He	null
resembles	null
Fielding	null
as	null
an	null
eagle	null
does	null
a	null
vulture	null
Fielding	null
could	null
stoop	null
on	null
carrion	null
but	null
Thackeray	null
never	null
does	null
His	null
wit	null
is	null
bright	null
his	null
humour	null
attractive	null
but	null
both	null
bear	null
the	null
same	null
relation	null
to	null
his	null
serious	null
genius	null

null	wrote

null	on

null	the

null	It
null	did

null	were
null	withdrawn
null	but
null	rather
null	as
null	if

null	were
null	gone
null	it
null	was
null	not
null	the
null	power
null	to
null	be
null	tranquil
null	which
null	had
null	failed
null	me
null	but
null	the

null	My

null	my

null	now
null	I
null	remembered
null	that
null	the

null	world
null	was

null	and
null	that
null	a
null	varied
null	field
null	of
null	hopes
null	and
null	fears
null	of
null	sensations
null	and

null	awaited

null	seek

null	amidst

null	I

null	There
