INTRODUCTION	null
With	null
the	null
title	null
of	null
Sense	null
and	null
Sensibility	null
is	null
connected	null
one	null
of	null
those	null
minor	null
problems	null
which	null
delight	null
the	null
cumminsplitters	null
of	null
criticism	null
In	null
the	null
Cecilia	null
of	null
Madame	null
DArblay	null
—	null
the	null
forerunner	null
if	null
not	null
the	null
model	null
of	null
Miss	null
Austen	null
—	null
is	null
a	null
sentence	null
which	null
at	null
first	null
sight	null
suggests	null
some	null
relationship	null
to	null
the	null
name	null
of	null
the	null
book	null
which	null
in	null
the	null
present	null
series	null
inaugurated	null
Miss	null
Austens	null
novelsThe	null
whole	null
of	null
this	null
unfortunate	null
business	null
—	null
says	null
a	null
certain	null
didactic	null
Dr	null
Lyster	null
talking	null
in	null
capitals	null
towards	null
the	null
end	null
of	null
volume	null
three	null
of	null
Cecilia	null
—has	null
been	null
the	null
result	null
of	null
Pride	null
and	null
Prejudiceand	null
looking	null
to	null
the	null
admitted	null
familiarity	null
of	null
Miss	null
Austen	null
with	null
Madame	null
DArblays	null
work	null
it	null
has	null
been	null
concluded	null
that	null
Miss	null
Austen	null
borrowed	null
from	null
Cecilia	null
the	null
title	null
of	null
her	null
second	null
novel	null
But	null
here	null
comes	null
in	null
the	null
little	null
problem	null
to	null
which	null
we	null
have	null
referred	null
Pride	null
and	null
Prejudice	null
it	null
is	null
true	null
was	null
written	null
and	null
finished	null
before	null
Sense	null
and	null
Sensibility	null
—	null
its	null
original	null
title	null
for	null
several	null
years	null
being	null
First	null
Impressions	null
Then	null
in	null
the	null
author	null
fell	null
to	null
work	null
upon	null
an	null
older	null
essay	null
in	null
letters	null
a	null
la	null
Richardson	null
called	null
Elinor	null
and	null
Marianne	null
which	null
she	null
re	null
christened	null
Sense	null
and	null
Sensibility	null
This	null
as	null
we	null
know	null
was	null
her	null
first	null
published	null
book	null
and	null
whatever	null
may	null
be	null
the	null
connection	null
between	null
the	null
title	null
of	null
Pride	null
and	null
Prejudice	null
and	null
the	null
passage	null
in	null
Cecilia	null
there	null
is	null
an	null
obvious	null
connection	null
between	null
the	null
title	null
of	null
Pride	null
and	null
Prejudice	null
and	null
the	null
title	null
of	null
Sense	null
and	null
Sensibility	null
If	null
Miss	null
Austen	null
revii	null
SENSE	null
AND	null
SENSIBILITY	null
christened	null
Elinor	null
and	null
Marianne	null
before	null
she	null
changed	null
the	null
title	null
of	null
First	null
Impressions	null
as	null
she	null
well	null
may	null
have	null
it	null
is	null
extremely	null
unlikely	null
that	null
the	null
name	null
of	null
Pride	null
and	null
Prejudice	null
has	null
anything	null
to	null
do	null
with	null
Cecilia	null
which	null
besides	null
had	null
been	null
published	null
at	null
least	null
twenty	null
years	null
before	null
Upon	null
the	null
whole	null
therefore	null
it	null
is	null
most	null
likely	null
that	null
the	null
passage	null
in	null
Madame	null
DArblay	null
is	null
a	null
mere	null
coincidence	null
and	null
that	null
in	null
Sense	null
and	null
Sensibility	null
as	null
well	null
as	null
in	null
the	null
novel	null
that	null
succeeded	null
it	null
in	null
publication	null
Miss	null
Austen	null
after	null
the	null
fashion	null
of	null
the	null
old	null
morality	null
plays	null
simply	null
substituted	null
the	null
leading	null
characteristics	null
of	null
her	null
principal	null
personages	null
for	null
their	null
names	null
Indeed	null
in	null
Sense	null
and	null
Sensibility	null
the	null
sense	null
of	null
Elinor	null
and	null
the	null
sensibility	null
or	null
rather	null
sensiblerie	null
of	null
Marianne	null
are	null
markedly	null
emphasised	null
in	null
the	null
opening	null
pages	null
of	null
the	null
book	null
But	null
Miss	null
Austen	null
subsequently	null
and	null
as	null
we	null
think	null
wisely	null
discarded	null
in	null
her	null
remaining	null
efforts	null
the	null
cheap	null
attraction	null
of	null
an	null
alliterative	null
title	null
Emma	null
and	null
Persuasion	null
Northanger	null
Abbey	null
and	null
Mansfield	null
Park	null
are	null
names	null
far	null
more	null
in	null
consonance	null
with	null
the	null
quiet	null
tone	null
of	null
her	null
easy	null
and	null
unobtrusive	null
art	null
Elinor	null
and	null
Marianne	null
was	null
originally	null
written	null
about	null
After	null
the	null
completion	null
—	null
or	null
partial	null
completion	null
for	null
it	null
was	null
again	null
revised	null
in	null
—	null
of	null
First	null
Impressions	null
subsequently	null
Pride	null
and	null
Prejudice	null
Miss	null
Austen	null
set	null
about	null
recasting	null
Elinor	null
and	null
Marianne	null
then	null
composed	null
in	null
the	null
form	null
of	null
letters	null
and	null
she	null
had	null
no	null
sooner	null
accomplished	null
this	null
task	null
than	null
she	null
began	null
Northanger	null
Abbey	null
It	null
would	null
be	null
interesting	null
to	null
know	null
to	null
what	null
extent	null
she	null
remodelled	null
Sense	null
and	null
Sensibility	null
in	null
for	null
we	null
are	null
told	null
that	null
previous	null
to	null
its	null
publication	null
in	null
she	null
again	null
devoted	null
a	null
considerable	null
time	null
to	null
its	null
preparation	null
for	null
the	null
press	null
and	null
it	null
is	null
clear	null
that	null
this	null
does	null
not	null
mean	null
the	null
correction	null
of	null
proofs	null
alone	null
but	null
also	null
a	null
preliminary	null
revision	null
of	null
MS	null
Especially	null
would	null
it	null
be	null
interesting	null
if	null
we	null
could	null
ascertain	null
whether	null
any	null
of	null
its	null
more	null
finished	null
passages	null
eg	null
the	null
admirable	null
conversation	null

between	null
the	null
Miss	null
Dashwoods	null
and	null
Willoughby	null
in	null
chapter	null
x	null
were	null
the	null
result	null
of	null
those	null
fallow	null
and	null
apparently	null
barren	null
years	null
at	null
Bath	null
and	null
Southampton	null
or	null
whether	null
they	null
were	null
already	null
part	null
of	null
the	null
second	null
version	null
of	null
But	null
upon	null
this	null
matter	null
the	null
records	null
are	null
mute	null
A	null
careful	null
examination	null
of	null
the	null
correspondence	null
published	null
by	null
Lord	null
Brabourne	null
in	null
only	null
reveals	null
two	null
definite	null
references	null
to	null
Sense	null
and	null
Sensibility	null
and	null
these	null
are	null
absolutely	null
unfruitful	null
in	null
suggestion	null
In	null
April	null
she	null
speaks	null
of	null
having	null
corrected	null
two	null
sheets	null
ofS	null
and	null
Swhich	null
she	null
has	null
scarcely	null
a	null
hope	null
of	null
getting	null
out	null
in	null
the	null
following	null
June	null
and	null
in	null
September	null
an	null
extract	null
from	null
the	null
diary	null
of	null
another	null
member	null
of	null
the	null
family	null
indirectly	null
discloses	null
the	null
fact	null
that	null
the	null
book	null
had	null
by	null
that	null
time	null
been	null
published	null
This	null
extract	null
is	null
a	null
brief	null
reference	null
to	null
a	null
letter	null
which	null
had	null
been	null
received	null
from	null
Cassandra	null
Austen	null
begging	null
her	null
correspondent	null
not	null
to	null
mention	null
that	null
Aunt	null
Jane	null
wrote	null
Sense	null
and	null
Sensibility	null
Beyond	null
these	null
minute	null
items	null
of	null
information	null
and	null
the	null
statement	null
—	null
already	null
referred	null
to	null
in	null
the	null
Introduction	null
to	null
Pride	null
and	null
Prejudice	null
—	null
that	null
she	null
considered	null
herself	null
overpaid	null
for	null
the	null
labour	null
she	null
had	null
bestowed	null
upon	null
it	null
absolutely	null
nothing	null
seems	null
to	null
have	null
been	null
preserved	null
by	null
her	null
descendants	null
respecting	null
her	null
first	null
printed	null
effort	null
In	null
the	null
absence	null
of	null
particulars	null
some	null
of	null
her	null
critics	null
have	null
fallen	null
to	null
speculate	null
upon	null
the	null
reason	null
which	null
made	null
her	null
select	null
it	null
and	null
not	null
Pride	null
and	null
Prejudice	null
for	null
her	null
debut	null
and	null
they	null
have	null
perhaps	null
naturally	null
found	null
in	null
the	null
fact	null
a	null
fresh	null
confirmation	null
of	null
that	null
traditional	null
blindness	null
of	null
authors	null
to	null
their	null
own	null
best	null
work	null
which	null
is	null
one	null
of	null
the	null
commonplaces	null
of	null
literary	null
history	null
But	null
this	null
is	null
to	null
premise	null
that	null
she	null
did	null
regard	null
it	null
as	null
her	null
masterpiece	null
a	null
fact	null
which	null
apart	null
from	null
this	null
accident	null
of	null
priority	null
of	null
issue	null
is	null
as	null
far	null
as	null
we	null
are	null
aware	null
nowhere	null
asserted	null
A	null
simpler	null
solution	null
is	null
probably	null
that	null
of	null
the	null
three	null
novels	null
she	null
had	null
written	null
or	null
sketched	null
by	null
Pride	null
and	null
Prejudice	null
was	null
languishing	null
under	null
the	null
stigma	null
of	null
having	null
been	null
refused	null
by	null
one	null
bookseller	null

SENSE	null
AND	null
SENSIBILITY	null
without	null

formality	null

while	null
Northanger	null
Abbey	null
was	null
lying	null
perdu	null
in	null
another	null
booksellers	null
drawer	null
at	null
Bath	null
In	null
these	null
circumstances	null
it	null
is	null
intelligible	null
that	null
she	null
should	null
turn	null
to	null
Sense	null
and	null
Sensibility	null
when	null
at	null
length	null
—	null
upon	null
the	null
occasion	null
of	null
a	null
visit	null
to	null

in	null
the	null

of	null

with	null

Surely	null
Mr	null
Egerton	null
who	null
had	null
visited	null
Miss	null

at	null
Sloane	null

must	null
have	null

conveyed	null
to	null

some	null
intelligence	null
of	null
the	null
way	null
in	null
which	null
her	null
work	null
had	null

by	null
the	null
public	null

if	null
he	null

it	null

no	null

Mr	null
Austen	null
Leigh	null
her	null

As	null
far	null
as	null
it	null
is	null
possible	null
to	null
judge	null
the	null
critical	null
verdicts	null
she	null
obtained	null
were	null
mainly	null
derived	null
from	null
her	null
own	null
relatives	null

of	null

may	null
trust	null
a	null
little	null

which	null
she	null

and	null
from	null

out	null
very	null
