EXPLANATORY	null
In	null
this	null
book	null
a	null
number	null
of	null
dialects	null
are	null
used	null
to	null
wit	null
the	null
Missouri	null
negro	null
dialect	null
the	null
extremest	null
form	null
of	null
the	null
backwoods	null
SouthWestern	null
dialect	null
the	null
ordinary	null
PikeCounty	null
dialect	null
and	null
four	null
modified	null
varieties	null
of	null
this	null
last	null
The	null
shadings	null
have	null
not	null
been	null
done	null
in	null
a	null
haphazard	null
fashion	null
or	null
by	null
guesswork	null
but	null
painstakingly	null
and	null
with	null
the	null
trustworthy	null
guidance	null
and	null
support	null
of	null
personal	null
familiarity	null
with	null
these	null
several	null
forms	null
of	null
speech	null
I	null
make	null
this	null
explanation	null
for	null
the	null
reason	null
that	null
without	null
it	null
many	null
readers	null
would	null
suppose	null
that	null
all	null
these	null
characters	null
were	null
trying	null
to	null
talk	null
alike	null
and	null
not	null
succeeding	null

A	null
nation	null
lives	null
in	null
its	null
literature	null
which	null
unless	null
it	null
be	null
imitative	null
reflects	null
the	null
character	null
of	null
thought	null
of	null
every	null
period	null
through	null
which	null
the	null
nation	null
passes	null
Here	null
is	null
the	null
record	null
of	null
patriotism	null
of	null
the	null
struggles	null
for	null
religious	null
and	null
political	null
liberty	null
and	null
here	null
also	null
we	null
find	null
depicted	null
the	null

the	null

The	null

few	null
isolated	null

exhausted	null
by	null
eight	null

into	null
a	null

also	null
witnessed	null
the	null
growth	null

a	null

a	null
literature	null
keeping	null
pace	null
with	null
our	null
wonderful	null
material	null
prosperity	null
and	null
equally	null
a	null
matter	null
of	null
national	null
pride	null
and	null
national	null
importance	null
The	null
truth	null
of	null
this	null
assertion	null
is	null
made	null
evident	null
by	null
the	null
numerous	null

increasing	null

a	null
work	null
embodying	null

a	null

all	null
that	null
was	null

so	null
that	null

of	null
our	null

might	null
be	null
reflected	null
in	null
the	null

of	null
its	null

written	null
by	null

both	null
the	null

were	null
careful	null

make	null
this	null
