INTRODUCTION	null
The	null
Publishers	null
of	null
the	null
Standard	null
Novels	null
in	null
selectingFrankensteinfor	null
one	null
of	null
their	null
series	null
expressed	null
a	null
wish	null
that	null
I	null
should	null
furnish	null
them	null
with	null
some	null
account	null
of	null
the	null
origin	null
of	null
the	null
story	null
I	null
am	null
the	null
more	null
willing	null
to	null
comply	null
because	null
I	null
shall	null
thus	null
give	null
a	null
general	null
answer	null
to	null
the	null
question	null
so	null
very	null
frequently	null
asked	null
me	null
—	null
How	null
I	null
then	null
a	null
young	null
girl	null
came	null
to	null
think	null
of	null
and	null
to	null
dilate	null
upon	null
so	null
very	null
hideous	null
an	null
idea	null
It	null
is	null
true	null
that	null
I	null
am	null
very	null
averse	null
to	null
bringing	null
myself	null
forward	null
in	null
print	null
but	null
as	null
my	null
account	null
will	null
only	null
appear	null
as	null
an	null
appendage	null
to	null
a	null
former	null
production	null
and	null
as	null
it	null
will	null
be	null
confined	null
to	null
such	null
topics	null
as	null
have	null
connection	null
with	null
my	null
authorship	null
alone	null
I	null
can	null
scarcely	null
accuse	null
myself	null
of	null
a	null
personal	null
intrusion	null
It	null
is	null
not	null
singular	null
that	null
as	null
the	null
daughter	null
of	null
two	null
persons	null
of	null
distinguished	null
literary	null
celebrity	null
I	null
should	null
very	null
early	null
in	null
life	null
have	null
thought	null
of	null
writing	null
As	null
a	null
child	null
I	null
scribbled	null
and	null
my	null
favourite	null
pastime	null
during	null
the	null
hours	null
given	null
me	null
for	null
recreation	null
was	null
to	null
write	null
storiesStill	null
I	null
had	null
a	null
dearer	null
pleasure	null
than	null
this	null
which	null
was	null
the	null
formation	null
of	null
castles	null
in	null
the	null
air	null
—	null
the	null
indulging	null
in	null
waking	null
dreams	null
—	null
the	null
following	null
up	null
trains	null
of	null
thought	null
which	null
had	null
for	null
their	null
subject	null
the	null
formation	null
of	null
a	null

In	null

as	null
a	null

Scotland	null
I	null

where	null
unheeded	null
I	null
could	null

with	null
the	null

Lord	null

of	null
the	null
grim	null
terrors	null
of	null
my	null
waking	null
dream	null
At	null
first	null
I	null
thought	null
but	null
of	null
a	null
few	null
pages—	null
of	null
a	null
short	null
tale	null
but	null
null	Godwin
Shelley	Shelley
urged	null
me	null
to	null
develop	null
the	null
idea	null
at	null
greater	null
length	null
I	null
certainly	null
did	null
not	null
owe	null
the	null
suggestion	null
of	null
one	null
incident	null
nor	null
scarcely	null
of	null
one	null
train	null
of	null
feeling	null
to	null
my	null
husband	null
and	null
yet	null
but	null
for	null
his	null
incitement	null
it	null
would	null
never	null
have	null
taken	null
the	null
form	null
in	null
which	null
it	null
was	null
presented	null
to	null
the	null
world	null
From	null
this	null
declaration	null
I	null
must	null
except	null
the	null
preface	null
As	null
far	null
as	null
I	null
can	null
recollect	null
it	null
was	null
entirely	null
written	null
by	null
him	null
And	null
now	null
once	null
again	null
I	null
bid	null
my	null
hideous	null
progeny	null
go	null
forth	null
and	null
prosper	null
I	null
have	null
an	null
affection	null
for	null
it	null
for	null
it	null
was	null
the	null
offspring	null
of	null
happy	null
days	null
when	null
death	null
and	null
grief	null
were	null
but	null
words	null
which	null
found	null
no	null
true	null
echo	null
in	null
my	null
heart	null
Its	null
several	null
pages	null
speak	null
of	null
many	null
a	null
walk	null
many	null
a	null
drive	null
and	null
many	null
a	null
conversation	null
when	null
I	null
was	null
not	null
alone	null
and	null
my	null
companion	null
was	null
one	null
who	null
in	null
this	null
world	null
I	null
shall	null
never	null
see	null
more	null
But	null
this	null
is	null
for	null

my	null

nothing	null

I	null

one	null
word	null
as	null
to	null
the	null
alterations	null
I	null
have	null
made	null
They	null
are	null
principally	null
those	null
of	null

I	null
have	null
changed	null
no	null
portion	null
of	null
the	null
story	null
nor	null
introduced	null
any	null
new	null
ideas	null
or	null
circumstances	null
I	null
have	null
mended	null
the	null
language	null
where	null
it	null
was	null
so	null
bald	null
as	null
to	null
interfere	null
with	null

almost	null

PREFACE	null
The	null
event	null
on	null
which	null
this	null
fiction	null
is	null
founded	null
has	null
been	null
supposed	null
by	null
Dr	null
Darwin	null
and	null
some	null
of	null
the	null
physiological	null
writers	null
of	null
Germany	null
as	null
not	null
of	null
impossible	null
occurrence	null
I	null
shall	null
not	null
be	null
supposed	null
as	null
according	null
the	null
remotest	null
degree	null
of	null
serious	null
faith	null
to	null
such	null
an	null
imagination	null
yet	null
in	null
assuming	null
it	null
as	null
the	null
basis	null
of	null
a	null
work	null
of	null
fancy	null
I	null
have	null
not	null
considered	null
myself	null
as	null
merely	null
weaving	null
a	null
series	null
of	null
supernatural	null
terrors	null
The	null
event	null
on	null
which	null
the	null
interest	null
of	null
the	null
story	null
depends	null
is	null
exempt	null
from	null
the	null
disadvantages	null
of	null
a	null
mere	null
tale	null
of	null
spectres	null
or	null
enchantment	null
It	null
was	null
recommended	null
by	null
the	null
novelty	null
of	null
the	null
situations	null
which	null
it	null
developes	null
and	null
however	null
impossible	null
as	null
a	null
physical	null
fact	null
affords	null
a	null
point	null
of	null
view	null
to	null
the	null
imagination	null
for	null
the	null
delineating	null
of	null
human	null
passions	null
more	null
comprehensive	null
and	null
commanding	null
than	null
any	null
which	null
the	null
ordinary	null
relations	null
of	null
existing	null

can	null
yield	null
I	null
nave	null
thus	null
endeavoured	null
to	null
preserve	null
the	null
truth	null
of	null
the	null
elementary	null
principles	null
of	null
human	null
nature	null
while	null
I	null
have	null
not	null
scrupled	null
to	null

have	null
resulted	null
in	null
the	null

The	null
circumstance	null
on	null
which	null
my	null
story	null
rests	null
was	null
suggested	null
in	null
casual	null
conversation	null
It	null
was	null
commenced	null
partly	null
as	null
a	null
source	null
of	null
amusement	null
and	null
partly	null
as	null
an	null
expedient	null
for	null
exercising	null
any	null
untried	null
resources	null
of	null
mind	null
Other	null
motives	null
were	null
mingled	null
with	null
these	null
as	null
the	null
work	null
proceeded	null
I	null
am	null
by	null
no	null
means	null
indifferent	null
to	null
the	null
manner	null
in	null
which	null
whatever	null
moral	null
tendencies	null
exist	null
in	null
the	null
sentiments	null
or	null
characters	null
it	null
contains	null
shall	null
affect	null
the	null
reader	null
yet	null
my	null
chief	null
concern	null
in	null
this	null
respect	null
has	null
been	null
limited	null
to	null
the	null
avoiding	null
the	null
enervating	null
effects	null
of	null
the	null
novels	null
of	null
the	null
present	null
day	null
and	null
to	null
the	null
exhibition	null
of	null
the	null
amiableness	null
of	null
domestic	null
affection	null
and	null
the	null
excellence	null
of	null
universal	null
virtue	null
The	null
opinions	null
which	null
naturally	null
spring	null
from	null
the	null
character	null
and	null
situation	null
of	null
the	null
hero	null
are	null
by	null
no	null
means	null
to	null
be	null
conceived	null
as	null
existing	null
always	null
in	null
my	null
own	null
conviction	null
nor	null

any	null

It	null
is	null
a	null
subject	null
also	null
of	null
additional	null
interest	null
to	null
the	null
author	null
that	null
this	null
story	null
was	null
begun	null
in	null
the	null

the	null
scene	null
is	null
principally	null
laid	null
and	null
in	null
society	null
which	null
cannot	null

to	null
be	null
regretted	null
I	null
passed	null
the	null
summer	null
of	null
in	null
the	null
environs	null
of	null
Geneva	null
The	null
season	null
was	null
cold	null
