INTRODUCTION	null
It	null
was	null
just	null
sixty	null
years	null
ago	null
that	null
the	null
Englishspeaking	null
world	null
began	null
to	null
recognise	null
a	null
master	null
of	null
fiction	null
and	null
a	null
man	null
of	null
genius	null
in	null
William	null
Makepeace	null
Thackeray	null
The	null
year	null
before	null
this	null
young	null
man	null
of	null
letters	null
then	null
thirty	null
five	null
years	null
old	null
known	null
as	null
a	null
contributor	null
to	null
Punch	null
and	null
author	null
of	null
sundry	null
stories	null
and	null
sketches	null
liked	null
by	null
his	null
confreres	null
but	null
not	null
yet	null
very	null
highly	null
esteemed	null
by	null
the	null
general	null
public	null
removed	null
from	null
St	null
James	null
Street	null
to	null
No	null
then	null
No	null
Young	null
Street	null
Long	null
afterwards	null
in	null
a	null
rollicking	null
mood	null
he	null
pointed	null
out	null
this	null
house	null
to	null
his	null
friend	null
Jarnes	null
T	null
Fields	null
the	null
Boston	null
publisher	null
saying	null
Down	null
on	null
your	null
knees	null
you	null
rogue	null
for	null
here	null
Vanity	null
Fair	null
was	null
penned	null
and	null
I	null
will	null
go	null
down	null
with	null
you	null
for	null
I	null
have	null
a	null
high	null
opinion	null
of	null
that	null
little	null
production	null
myself	null
At	null
first	null
neither	null
the	null
publishers	null
nor	null
the	null
public	null
agreed	null
with	null
him	null
about	null
his	null
little	null
production	null
Colburn	null
in	null
fact	null
refused	null
it	null
outright	null
even	null
for	null
his	null
magazine	null
Meantime	null
the	null
author	null
was	null
agonising	null
over	null
a	null
title	null
He	null
told	null
the	null
outcome	null
himself	null
like	null
the	null
overgrown	null
boy	null
he	null
remained	null
on	null
one	null
side	null
of	null
his	null
nature	null
to	null
the	null
end	null
I	null
jumped	null
out	null
of	null
bed	null
in	null
the	null
middle	null
of	null
the	null
night	null
and	null
ran	null
three	null
times	null
round	null
my	null
room	null
uttering	null
as	null
I	null
went	null
Vanity	null
Fair	null
Vanity	null
Fair	null
Vanity	null
Fair	null
With	null
this	null
new	null
title	null
and	null
on	null
a	null
cursory	null
examination	null
of	null
the	null
earlier	null
pages	null
the	null
story	null
was	null
at	null
last	null
accepted	null
by	null
the	null
proprietors	null
of	null
Punch	null
and	null
it	null
began	null
to	null
appear	null
in	null
monthly	null
parts	null
in	null
January	null
The	null
critics	null
found	null
the	null
opening	null
chapters	null
dull	null
the	null
public	null
did	null
not	null
seem	null
attracted	null
and	null
the	null
publishers	null
even	null
hesitated	null
about	null
continuing	null
the	null
serial	null
publication	null
The	null
fame	null
of	null
Dickens	null
was	null
already	null
established	null
Dombey	null
and	null
Son	null
was	null
then	null
appearing	null
once	null
a	null
month	null
in	null
green	null
paper	null
covers	null
and	null
the	null
yellowcovered	null
Vanity	null
Fair	null
did	null
not	null
seem	null
to	null
furnish	null
a	null
counterattraction	null
At	null
last	null
after	null
some	null
eight	null
numbers	null
had	null
been	null
issued	null
Mrs	null
Carlyle	null
who	null
had	null
a	null
faculty	null
of	null
seeing	null
things	null
in	null
literature	null
sooner	null
than	null
publishers	null
or	null
the	null
public	null
read	null
one	null
of	null
the	null
parts	null
during	null
vii	null
viii	null
Introduction	null
the	null
night	null
and	null
wrote	null
to	null
her	null
husband	null
about	null
it	null
Very	null
good	null
indeed	null
beats	null
Dickens	null
out	null
of	null
the	null
world	null
By	null
the	null
time	null
ten	null
out	null
of	null
the	null
twenty	null
monthly	null
parts	null
had	null
appeared	null
Ttie	null
Edinburgh	null
Review	null
had	null
discovered	null
it	null
to	null
such	null
purpose	null
that	null
the	null
reviewer	null
Hayward	null
prompted	null
they	null
say	null
by	null
Barry	null
Cornwalls	null
wife	null
Mrs	null
Procter	null
declared	null
that	null
Vanity	Vanity
Fair	Fair
is	null
as	null
sure	null
of	null
immortality	null
as	null
ninetnine	null
hundredths	null
of	null
modern	null
novels	null
are	null
sure	null
of	null
annihilation	null
And	null
then	null
came	null
the	null
appreciation	null
that	null
might	null
well	null
count	null
most	null
of	null
all	null
the	null
tribute	null
of	null
Charlotte	null
Bronte	null
in	null
December	null
There	null
is	null
a	null
man	null
in	null
our	null
own	null
days	null
whose	null
words	null
are	null
not	null
framed	null
to	null
tickle	null
delicate	null
ears	null
who	null
to	null
my	null
thinking	null
comes	null
before	null
the	null
great	null
ones	null
of	null
society	null
much	null
as	null
the	null
son	null
of	null
Imlah	null
came	null
before	null
the	null
throned	null
Kings	null
of	null
Judah	null
and	null
Israel	null
and	null
who	null
speaks	null
truth	null
as	null
deep	null
with	null
a	null
power	null
as	null
prophetlike	null
and	null
as	null
vital	null
a	null
mien	null
as	null
dauntless	null
and	null
as	null
daring	null
Why	null
have	null
I	null
alluded	null
to	null
this	null
man	null
Because	null
I	null
think	null
I	null
see	null
in	null
him	null
an	null
intellect	null
pro	null
founder	null
and	null
more	null
unique	null
than	null
his	null
contemporaries	null
have	null
yet	null
recognised	null
because	null
I	null
regard	null
him	null
as	null
the	null
first	null
social	null
regenerator	null
of	null
the	null
day	null
—	null
as	null
the	null
very	null
master	null
of	null
that	null
working	null
corps	null
who	null
would	null
restore	null
to	null
rectitude	null
the	null
warped	null
system	null
of	null
things	null
because	null
I	null
think	null
no	null
commentator	null
on	null
his	null
writings	null
has	null
yet	null
found	null
the	null
comparison	null
that	null
suits	null
him	null
the	null
terms	null
which	null
rightly	null
characterise	null
his	null
talent	null
They	null
say	null
he	null
is	null
like	null
Fielding	null
they	null
talk	null
of	null
his	null
wit	null
humour	null
comic	null
powers	null
He	null
resembles	null
Fielding	null
as	null
an	null
eagle	null
does	null
a	null
vulture	null
Fielding	null
could	null
stoop	null
on	null
carrion	null
but	null
Thackeray	null
never	null
does	null
His	null
wit	null
is	null
bright	null
his	null
humour	null
attractive	null
but	null
both	null
bear	null
the	null
same	null
relation	null
to	null
his	null
serious	null
genius	null
that	null
the	null
mere	null
lambent	null
sheetlightning	null
playing	null
under	null
the	null
edge	null
of	null
the	null
summer	null
cloud	null
does	null
to	null
the	null
electric	null
deathspark	null
hid	null
in	null
its	null
womb	null
Finally	null
I	null
have	null
alluded	null
to	null
Mr	null
Thackeray	null
because	null
to	null
him	null
—	null
if	null
he	null
will	null
accept	null
the	null
tribute	null
of	null
a	null
total	null
stranger	null
—	null
I	null
have	null
dedicated	null
this	null
second	null
edition	null
of	null
Jane	null
Eyre	null
The	null
recognition	null
was	null
complete	null
at	null
the	null
end	null
of	null
the	null
year	null
in	null
which	null
the	null
publication	null
was	null
begun	null
and	null
when	null
little	null
more	null
than	null
half	null
the	null
work	null
had	null
appeared	null
the	null
literary	null
world	null
of	null
Britain	null
and	null
America	null
opened	null
to	null
and	null
acclaimed	null
a	null
new	null
master	null
Just	null
about	null
sixty	null
years	null
to	null
a	null
month	null
after	null
the	null
time	null
when	null
the	null
author	null
was	null
still	null
hunting	null
publishers	null
and	null
springing	null
from	null
his	null
bed	null
in	null
the	null
middle	null
of	null
the	null
night	null
to	null
race	null
about	null
his	null
room	null
in	null
boyish	null
delight	null
over	null
having	null
found	null
a	null
title	null
a	null
group	null
of	null
British	null
wits	null
and	null
authors	null
under	null
the	null
name	null
of	null
the	null
Titmarsh	null
Club	null
were	null
assembled	null
Introduction	null
ix	null
in	null
London	null
in	null
memory	null
of	null
this	null
great	null
wit	null
and	null
author	null
their	null
countryman	null
They	null
chose	null
to	null
put	null
the	null
American	null
Ambassador	null
in	null
the	null
chair	null
and	null
the	null
publishers	null
of	null
Everymans	null
Library	null
are	null
good	null
enough	null
to	null
suggest	null
that	null
the	null
few	null
words	null
then	null
uttered	null
might	null
properly	null
enough	null
be	null
here	null
reproduced	null
For	null
this	null
distinction	null
there	null
and	null
here	null
I	null
must	null
be	null
indebted	null
to	null
the	null
same	null
cause	null
—	null
a	null
kindly	null
recollection	null
of	null
the	null
fact	null
that	null
the	null
great	null
author	null
found	null
his	null
audience	null
in	null
America	null
almost	null
if	null
not	null
quite	null
as	null
soon	null
as	null
at	null
home	null
that	null
he	null
always	null
held	null
it	null
and	null
holds	null
it	null
still	null
And	null
perhaps	null
too	null
it	null
may	null
be	null
remembered	null
that	null
Mr	null
Thackeray	null
seemed	null
to	null
like	null
us	null
nearly	null
as	null
well	null
as	null
we	null
liked	null
him	null
and	null
was	null
never	null
weary	null
of	null
showing	null
his	null
goodwill	null
—	null
even	null
when	null
he	null
was	null
somewhat	null
more	null
lonely	null
in	null
such	null
manifestations	null
than	null
he	null
would	null
be	null
now	null
I	null
never	null
had	null
the	null
good	null
fortune	null
to	null
meet	null
Mr	null
Thackeray	null
in	null
America	null
though	null
I	null
did	null
meet	null
soon	null
afterwards	null
the	null
other	null
great	null
British	null
novelist	null
of	null
that	null
period	null
But	null
for	null
years	null
I	null
was	null
constantly	null
hearing	null
gossip	null
about	null
Thackeray	null
from	null
those	null
who	null
had	null
met	null
him	null
during	null
his	null
visits	null
to	null
us	null
like	null
the	null
genial	null
publisher	null
who	null
was	null
his	null
guide	null
philosopher	null
and	null
friend	null
among	null
the	null
Brahmins	null
of	null
Boston	null
or	null
like	null
the	null
old	null
Centurions	null
of	null
New	null
York	null
Their	null
accounts	null
ran	null
all	null
one	null
way	null
They	null
admired	null
his	null
talk	null
and	null
they	null
loved	null
him	null
They	null
pictured	null
him	null
as	null
big	null
hearty	null
and	null
very	null
human	null
They	null
didnt	null
find	null
him	null
playing	null
the	null
lion	null
the	null
least	null
little	null
bit	null
and	null
we	null
may	null
hope	null
he	null
didnt	null
find	null
us	null
playing	null
the	null
spread	null
eagle	null
too	null
much	null
They	null
pointed	null
out	null
the	null
corner	null
in	null
the	null
Century	null
Club	null
where	null
he	null
used	null
to	null
sit	null
exchanging	null
literary	null
chat	null
or	null
in	null
Yankee	null
parlance	null
swapping	null
stories	null
with	null
a	null
group	null
of	null
club	null
men	null
about	null
him	null
They	null
could	null
tell	null
you	null
years	null
afterwards	null
what	null
had	null
been	null
Thackerays	null
favourite	null
chair	null
and	null
some	null
had	null
even	null
been	null
so	null
observant	null
of	null
the	null
least	null
trifles	null
about	null
the	null
great	null
man	null
as	null
to	null
know	null
what	null
particular	null
concoction	null
in	null
a	null
club	null
tumbler	null
had	null
been	null
his	null
favourite	null
nightcap	null
There	null
was	null
never	null
any	null
lack	null
of	null
admiration	null
for	null
the	null
other	null
great	null
novelist	null
to	null
whom	null
I	null
have	null
referred	null
even	null
when	null
we	null
were	null
still	null
thinskinned	null
and	null
The	null
American	null
Notes	null
and	null
Martin	null
Chuzzlewit	null
were	null
still	null
fresh	null
from	null
the	null
press	null
But	null
there	null
was	null
no	null
such	null
social	null
and	null
club	null
tradition	null
of	null
Dickens	null
Perhaps	null
the	null
reason	null
is	null
not	null
obscure	null
Dickens	null
painted	null
us	null
for	null
the	null
very	null
eyes	null
in	null
all	null
the	null
world	null
wherein	null
we	null
were	null
then	null
most	null
anxious	null
to	null
look	null
well	null
in	null
the	null
books	null
I	null
have	null
just	null
named	null
Thackeray	null
represented	null
America	null
to	null
the	null
Mother	null
Country	null
in	null
the	null
persons	null
of	null
Henry	null
Esmond	null
and	null
George	null
Washington	null
No	null
doubt	null
we	null
had	null
our	null
Jefferson	null
Bricks	null
and	null
Elijah	null
Pograms	null
too	null
I	null
do	null
not	null
deny	null
it	null
and	null
do	null
not	null
deny	null
that	null
x	null
Introduction	null
they	null
were	null
painted	null
to	null
the	null
life	null
But	null
we	null
were	null
human	null
enough	null
to	null
like	null
it	null
better	null
when	null
the	null
others	null
were	null
presented	null
as	null
our	null
national	null
types	null
No	null
such	null
consideration	null
however	null
affected	null
the	null
publishers	null
touchstone	null
—	null
and	null
I	null
am	null
afraid	null
the	null
touchstone	null
of	null
most	null
men	null
of	null
letters	null
too	null
—	null
the	null
sales	null
These	null
went	null
on	null
in	null
America	null
very	null
much	null
as	null
they	null
did	null
in	null
Great	null
Britain	null
—	null
perhaps	null
more	null
so	null
The	null
great	null
popular	null
circulation	null
came	null
to	null
Dickens	null
the	null
audience	null
fit	null
though	null
fewer	null
to	null
Thackeray	null
I	null
have	null
not	null
seen	null
the	null
late	null
figures	null
but	null
I	null
fancy	null
that	null
the	null
disparity	null
in	null
sales	null
is	null
less	null
nowadays	null
Few	null
reasonably	null
comprehensive	null
private	null
libraries	null
are	null
without	null
the	null
works	null
of	null
one	null
if	null
not	null
both	null
but	null
I	null
believe	null
that	null
in	null
the	null
severer	null
collections	null
of	null
pure	null
literature	null
the	null
name	null
under	null
which	null
the	null
Titmarsh	null
Club	null
assembles	null
has	null
begun	null
to	null
lead	null
We	null
must	null
not	null
think	null
of	null
anything	null
more	null
nearly	null
approaching	null
comparison	null
between	null
these	null
two	null
men	null
of	null
genius	null
It	null
would	null
be	null
utterly	null
idle	null
if	null
not	null
impossible	null
If	null
there	null
were	null
comparisons	null
once	null
and	null
if	null
a	null
shade	null
of	null
coolness	null
ever	null
crept	null
between	null
them	null
let	null
us	null
recall	null
at	null
any	null
rate	null
with	null
pleasure	null
the	null
warm	null
public	null
references	null
Thackeray	null
so	null
frequently	null
volunteered	null
about	null
Dickens	null
Long	null
after	null
his	null
own	null
fame	null
was	null
firmly	null
established	null
he	null
could	null
find	null
no	null
better	null
way	null
to	null
point	null
his	null
dislike	null
of	null
a	null
certain	null
coarseness	null
in	null

I	null
think	null
of	null
these	null
past	null
writers	null
and	null
of	null
one	null
who	null
lives	null
amongst	null
us	null
now	null
and	null
am	null
grateful	null
for	null
the	null
innocent	null
laughter	null
and	null
the	null
sweet	null
and	null
unsullied	null
page	null
which	null
the	null
author	null
of	null
David	null
Copperfield	null
gives	null
to	null
my	null
children	null
And	null
again	null
in	null
the	null
course	null
of	null
a	null
more	null
elaborate	null
eulogy	null
he	null
told	null
how	null
his	null
daughters	null
read	null
Nicholas	null
Nickleby	null
for	null
amusement	null
when	null
they	null
were	null
wakeful	null
and	null
for	null
rest	null
when	null
they	null
were	null
tired	null
and	null
for	null
medicine	null
when	null
they	null
were	null
ill	null
and	null
how	null
they	null
demanded	null
of	null
him	null
Papa	null
why	null
dont	null
you	null
write	null
novels	null
like	null
Nicholas	null
Nickleby	null
He	null
closed	null
the	null
story	null
with	null
the	null
outburst	null
Alas	null
who	null
can	null
and	null
with	null
the	null
most	null
generous	null
of	null
tributes	null
Perhaps	null
I	null
may	null
now	null
say	null
without	null
comparisons	null
and	null
without	null
disparagement	null
or	null
offence	null
that	null
American	null
men	null
of	null
letters	null
are	null
apt	null
to	null
speak	null
with	null
particularly	null
warm	null
admiration	null
of	null
Thackeray	null
Simply	null
as	null
a	null
storyteller	null
they	null
may	null
not	null
rate	null
him	null
so	null
high	null
as	null
other	null
British	null
authors	null
—	null
not	null
in	null
fact	null
so	null
high	null
as	null
some	null
British	null
authors	null
of	null
today	null
They	null
may	null
even	null
hint	null
at	null
prolixity	null
and	null
at	null
the	null
frequency	null
with	null
which	null
the	null
innocent	null
reader	null
is	null
held	null
by	null
the	null
buttonhole	null
for	null
overmuch	null
moralising	null
But	null
criticism	null
is	null
silenced	null
all	null
are	null
carried	null
away	null
by	null
his	null
creations	null
of	null
character	null
by	by
the	null
keen	null
but	null
kindly	null
analysis	null
of	null
human	null
nature	null
the	null
scorn	null
of	null
meanness	null

Introduction	null

that	null
still	null
hates	null
to	null
wound	null
the	null
sentiment	null
at	null
once	null
healthy	null
manly	null
and	null
tender	null
the	null
splendid	null
humanity	null
As	null
for	null
his	null
style	null
it	null
is	null
thought	null
wellnigh	null
perfect	null
Leslie	null
Stephen	null
has	null
somewhere	null
told	null
us	null
that	null
at	null
the	null
beginning	null
if	null
not	null
to	null
the	null
end	null
this	null
style	null
was	null
the	null
work	null
of	null
constant	null
revision	null
and	null
interlineation	null
For	null
myself	null
I	null
do	null
not	null
believe	null
any	null
style	null
of	null
the	null
first	null
order	null
was	null
ever	null
attained	null
in	null
any	null
other	null
way	null
I	null
have	null
no	null
faith	null
—	null
here	null
perhaps	null
speaks	null
the	null
old	null
Editor	null
hardened	null
in	null
his	null
prejudices	null
—	null
but	null
I	null
have	null
no	null
sort	null
of	null
faith	null
in	null
the	null
things	null
that	null
are	null
written	null
at	null
a	null
dash	null
and	null
handed	null
you	null
without	null
a	null
change	null
of	null
a	null
word	null
It	null
was	null
no	null
less	null
a	null
genius	null
than	null
Sheridan	null
was	null

P	null
am	null

Mr	null

in	null
Mr	null

PreRaphaelitism	null
and	null
the	null
PreRaphaelite	null
Brotherhood	null
which	null
admirably	null
illustrates	null
the	null
opposite	null
view	null
Mr	null
Wingrove	null
Cook	null
is	null
reported	null
as	null
telling	null
how	null
Thackeray	null
wrote	null
and	null
how	null
Mr	null
Cook	null
would	null
have	null
written	null
We	null
talked	null
about	null
the	null
author	null
of	null
Vanity	null
Fair	null
Cook	null
saidThackeray	null
is	null
no	null
genius	null
He	null
was	null
my	null
schoolfellow	null
and	null
Ive	null
known	null
him	null
all	null
along	null
for	null
a	null
rather	null
able	null
and	null
plodding	null
gentleman	null
of	null
letters	null
nothing	null
more	null
amusing	null
enough	null
some	null
of	null
his	null
lucubrations	null
are	null
but	null
he	null
is	null
overrated	null
he	null
hammers	null
out	null
all	null
with	null
the	null
greatest	null
toil	null
Look	null
here	null
When	null
I	null
came	null
home	null
last	null
year	null
after	null
a	null
long	null
absence	null
abroad	null
I	null
invited	null
a	null
party	null
of	null
old	null
chums	null
to	null
come	null
and	null
dine	null
with	null
me	null
at	null
Hampton	null
Court	null
And	null
I	null
went	null
to	null
Thackeray	null
saying	null
Now	null
my	null
dear	null
fellow	null
you	null
must	null
come	null
and	null
dine	null
with	null
me	null
and	null
a	null
lot	null
of	null
ancient	null
cronies	null
next	null
Wednesday	null
Ah	null
mereturned	null
William	null
MakepeaceI	null
wishtwere	null
not	null
so	null
but	null
the	null
end	null
of	null
the	null
month	null
is	null
coming	null
and	null
so	null
far	null
I	null
have	null
not	null
written	null
a	null
line	null
of	null
my	null
new	null
number	null
and	null
I	null
have	null
put	null
aside	null
next	null
Wednesday	null
evening	null
to	null
go	null
down	null
to	null
some	null
quiet	null
lodgings	null
I	null
have	null
taken	null
at	null
Surbiton	null
to	null
make	null
a	null
big	null
innings	null
so	null
you	null
see	null
I	null
am	null
obliged	null
to	null
give	null
up	null
your	null
attractive	null
party	null
Im	null
truly	null
chagrined	null
Do	null
you	null
mean	null
to	null
tell	null
me	null
that	null
you	null
consider	null
the	null
writing	null
a	null
few	null
pages	null
of	null
your	null
story	null
a	null
sufficient	null
reason	null
for	null
breaking	null
through	null
our	null
good	null
fellowship	null
I	null
arguedWhy	null
I	null
could	null
write	null
twice	null
the	null
quantity	null
of	null
your	null
whole	null
number	null
ki	null
four	null
hours	null
AhThackeray	null
repliedI	null
know	null
too	null
well	null
that	null
I	null
could	null
not	null
and	null
if	null
I	null
gave	null
up	null
Wednesday	null
night	null
I	null
should	null
find	null
that	null
I	null
was	null
behind	null
and	null
all	null
my	null
sense	null
of	null
deliberate	null
judgment	null
would	null
go	null
It	null
would	null
not	null
do	null
indeed	null
It	null
was	null
no	null
use	null
arguing	null
with	null
him	null
and	null
I	null
had	null
to	null
give	null
him	null
up	null
Well	null
our	null
party	null
met	null
Every	null
one	null
asked	null
why	null
Thackeray	null
was	null
not	null
there	null
and	null
I	null
told	null
them	null
Nevertheless	null
we	null
had	null
a	null
jolly	null
evening	null
and	null
when	null
we	null
were	null
breaking	null
up	null
in	null
reply	null
to	null
an	null
inquiry	null
where	null
Surbiton	null
was	null
I	null
decided	null
that	null
we	null
would	null
drive	null
home	null
that	null
way	null
and	null
knock	null
up	null
W	null
M	null
Thackeray	null
We	null
arrived	null
at	null
the	null
dark	null
village	null
There	null
was	null
one	null
house	null
with	null
a	null
light	null
on	null
the	null
first	null
floor	null
it	null
was	null
easy	null
to	null
conclude	null
that	null
we	null
were	null
at	null
the	null
right	null
one	null
and	null
we	null
all	null
shouted	null
out	null
ThackerayThe	null
window	null
was	null
forthwith	null
opened	null
and	null
our	null
friend	null
appeared	null
recognising	null
us	null
he	null
said	null
quietlyOh	null
wait	null
a	null
minute	null
and	null
I	null
will	null
come	null
down	null
and	null
let	null
you	null
inHe	null
descended	null
and	null
opened	null
the	null
door	null
He	null
was	null
feverish	null
yet	null
very	null
calm	null
and	null
terribly	null
sober	null
We	null
flocked	null
in	null
and	null
I	null
preceded	null
the	null
party	null
upstairs	null
There	null
was	null
the	null
writingpad	null
with	null
some	null
sheets	null
of	null
notepaper	null
on	null
the	null
table	null
and	null
the	null

had	null
about	null
twelve	null
lines	null

Introduction	null
But	null
this	null
rambling	null
talk	null
must	null
riot	null
wander	null
on	null
As	null
I	null
have	null
been	null
thinking	null
of	null
this	null
man	null
whose	null
place	null
is	null
secure	null
among	null
the	null
immortals	null
whom	null
every	null
one	null
counts	null
in	null
the	null
first	null
rank	null
of	null
the	null
great	null
Victorians	null
I	null
could	null
not	null
help	null
recalling	null
that	null
exquisite	null
little	null

The	null
Spectator	null
Readers	null
will	null
remember	null
the	null
warm	null
tribute	null
it	null
pays	null
to	null
two	null
men	null
of	null
letters	null
then	null
lately	null
taken	null
away	null
one	null
from	null

I	null
may	null
presume	null
to	null
say	null
from	null
America	null
Thomas	null
Babington	null
Macaulay	null
and	null
Washington	null
Irving	null
He	null
called	null
them	null
the	null
Gibbon	null
and	null
Goldsmith	null
of	null
their	null
time	null
and	null
finally	null
applied	null
to	null
them	null
some	null
words	null
which	null
I	null
venture	null
to	null
think	null
men	null
of	null
letters	null
the	null
world	null
over	null
will	null
now	null
feel	null
that	null
we	null
may	null
apply	null
with	null
equal	null
justice	null

even	null
greater	null
fervour	null
to	null

Let	null
me	null
close	null
by	null

It	null
has	null
been	null
his	null
fortunate	null
lot	null
to	null
give	null
incalculable	null
happiness	null
and	null
delight	null
to	null
the	null
world	null
which	null
thanks	null
him	null
in	null
return	null
with	null
an	null
immense	null
kindliness	null

It	null
may	null
not	null
be	null
our	null
chance	null

to	null
be	null
endowed	null
with	null
such	null
merit	null
or	null
rewarded	null
with	null
such	null
fame	null
But	null
the	null
rewards	null
of	null
these	null
men	null
are	null
rewards	null
paid	null
to	null
our	null
service	null
We	null
may	null
not	null
win	null
the	null
baton	null

null	It

null	Sir
null	Pitt
null	Crawley
null	for
null	the
null	dignity
null	of

null	had

null	as

null	a

null	here
null	With

null	Rebecca
null	did

null	former
null	position

null	Governess
null	towards
null	them
null	but
null	recalled
null	it
null	frankly
null	and
null	kindly
null	and
null	asked
null	them
null	about
null	their
null	studies
null	with
null	great
null	gravity
null	and
null	told
null	them
null	that

null	had

null	of

null	many
null	and
null	many
null	a
null	day
null	and
null	longed
null	to
null	know
null	of
null	their
null	welfare
null	In
null	fact
null	you
null	would
null	have
null	supposed
null	that

null	since

null	had
null	left
null	them
null	she
null	had
null	not

null	in
null	her

null	and
null	to
null	take
null	the

null	interest
null	in
null	their

null	So
null	supposed
null	Lady
null	Crawley
null	herself
null	and
null	her
null	young
null	sisters
null	Shes
null	hardly
null	changed
null	since
null	eight

null	said

null	as

null	Those
null	redhaired

null	look

null	well
null	replied
null	the

null	Hers
null	is
null	much
null	darker
null	than
null	it
null	was
null	I
null	think
null	she
null	must
null	dye
null	it
null	Miss
null	Rosalind
null	added
null	She
null	is
null	stouter
null	too
null	and
null	altogether
null	improved
null	continued
null	Miss
null	Rosalind
null	who
null	was
null	disposed
null	to
null	be
null	very
null	fat
null	At
null	least
null	she
null	gives
null	herself
null	no
null	airs
null	and
null	remembers
null	that
null	she
null	was
null	our
null	Governess
null	once
null	Miss
null	Violet
null	said
null	intimating
null	that
null	it
null	befitted
null	all
null	governesses
null	to
null	keep
null	their
null	proper
null	place
null	and
null	forgetting
null	altogether
null	that
null	she
null	was

null	not
null	only
null	of
null	Sir
null	Walpole
null	Crawley
null	but
null	of
null	Mr
null	Dawson
null	of
null	Mudbury
null	and
null	so
null	had
null	a
null	coalscuttle
null	in
null	her

null	There
null	are

null	very
null	wellmeaning

null	in
Vanity	Vanity
Fair	Fair
null	who
null	are

null	It
null	cant

null	what
null	the
null	girls
null	at

null	said
null	that
null	her
null	mother
null	was
null	an

null	A
null	person
null	cant
null	help
null	their
null	birth
null	Rosalind
null	replied
null	with
null	great
null	liberality
null	And
null	I
null	agree
null	with
null	our
null	brother
null	that
null	as
null	she
null	is
null	in
null	the
null	family
null	of
null	course
null	we

null	bound
null	to

null	and
null	absolutely
null	asked

null	I
null	wonder

null	she
null	looked
null	very
null	glum
null	upon
null	Mrs

an	null

for	null
the	null

and	null
the	null

preached	null
a	null

exhorting	null
the	null

Milton	null
ICTOR	null
HUGO	null
said	null
a	null
Library	null
was	null
an	null
act	null
of	null
faith	null
and	null
another	null
writer	null
spoke	null
of	null
one	null
so	null
beautiful	null
so	null
perfect	null
so	null
harmonious	null
in	null
all	null
its	null
parts	null
that	null
he	null
who	null
made	null
it	null
was	null
smitten	null
with	null
a	null
passion	null
In	null
that	null
faith	null
Everymans	null
Library	null
was	null
planned	null
out	null
originally	null
on	null
a	null
large	null
scale	null
and	null
the	null
idea	null
was	null
to	null
make	null
it	null
conform	null
as	null
far	null
as	null
possible	null
to	null
a	null
perfect	null
scheme	null
However	null
perfection	null
is	null
a	null
thing	null
to	null
be	null
aimed	null
at	null
and	null
not	null
to	null
be	null
achieved	null
in	null
this	null
difficult	null
world	null
and	null
since	null
the	null
first	null
volumes	null
appeared	null
some	null
years	null
ago	null
there	null
have	null
been	null
many	null
interruptions	null
chief	null
among	null
them	null
the	null
Great	null
War	null
of	null
during	null
which	null
even	null
the	null
City	null
of	null
Books	null
felt	null
a	null
world	null
commotion	null
But	null
the	null
series	null
is	null
now	null
getting	null
back	null
into	null
its	null
old	null
stride	null
and	null
looking	null
forward	null
to	null
complete	null
its	null
scheme	null
of	null
a	null
Thousand	null
Volumes	null
One	null
of	null
the	null
practical	null
expedients	null
in	null
the	null
original	null
plan	null
was	null
to	null
divide	null
the	null
volumes	null
into	null
separate	null
sections	null
as	null
Biography	null
Fiction	null
History	null
Belleslettres	null
Poetry	null
Philosophy	null
Romance	null
and	null
so	null
forth	null
with	null
a	null
shelf	null
for	null
Young	null
People	null
Last	null
and	null
not	null
least	null
there	null
was	null
one	null
of	null
Reference	null
Books	null
in	null
which	null
beside	null
the	null
dictionaries	null
and	null
encyclopaedias	null
to	null
be	null
expected	null
there	null
was	null
a	null
special	null
set	null
of	null
literary	null
and	null
historical	null
atlases	null
which	null
have	null
been	null
revised	null
from	null
time	null
to	null
time	null
so	null
as	null
to	null
chart	null
the	null
New	null
Europe	null
and	null
the	null
New	null
World	null
at	null
large	null
which	null
we	null
hope	null
will	null
preserve	null
Kants	null
Perpetual	null
Peace	null
under	null
the	null
auspices	null
of	null
the	null
League	null
of	null
Nations	null
at	null
Geneva	null
That	null
is	null
only	null
one	null
small	null
item	null
however	null
in	null
a	null
library	null
list	null
which	null
is	null
running	null
on	null
to	null
the	null
final	null
centuries	null
of	null
its	null
Thousand	null
The	null
largest	null
slice	null
of	null
this	null
huge	null
provision	null
is	null
as	null
a	null
matter	null
of	null
course	null
given	null
to	null
the	null
tyrannous	null
demands	null
of	null
fiction	null
But	null
in	null
carrying	null
out	null
the	null
scheme	null
publishers	null
and	null
editors	null
contrived	null
to	null
keep	null
in	null
mind	null
that	null
books	null
like	null
men	null
and	null
women	null
have	null
their	null
elective	null
affinities	null
The	null
present	null
volume	null
for	null
instance	null
will	null
be	null
found	null
to	null
have	null
its	null
companion	null
books	null
both	null
in	null
the	null
same	null
section	null
and	null
just	null
as	null
significantly	null
in	null
other	null
sections	null
With	null
that	null
idea	null
too	null
novels	null
like	null
Walter	null
Scotts	null
Ivanhoe	null
and	null
Fortunes	null
of	null
Nigel	null
Lyttons	null
Harold	null
and	null
Dickenss	null
Tale	null
of	null
Two	null
Cities	null
have	null
been	null
used	null
as	null
pioneers	null
of	null
history	null
and	null
treated	null
as	null
a	null
sort	null
of	null
holiday	null
history	null
books	null
For	null
in	null
our	null
day	null
history	null
is	null
tending	null
to	null
grow	null
more	null
documentary	null
and	null
less	null
literary	null
and	null
the	null
historian	null
who	null
is	null
a	null
stylist	null
as	null
one	null
of	null
our	null
contributors	null
the	null
late	null
Thomas	null
Seccombe	null
said	null
will	null
soon	null
be	null
regarded	null
as	null
a	null
kind	null
of	null
Phoenix	null
As	null
for	null
history	null
Everymans	null
Library	null
has	null
been	null
eclectic	null
enough	null
to	null
choose	null
its	null
historians	null
from	null
every	null
school	null
in	null
turn	null
including	null
Gibbon	null
Grote	null
Finlay	null
Macaulay	null
Motley	null
and	null
Prescott	null
while	null
among	null
earlier	null
books	null
may	null
be	null
noted	null
the	null
Venerable	null
Bede	null
and	null
the	null
AngloSaxon	null
Chronicle	null
On	null
the	null
classic	null
shelf	null
too	null
there	null
is	null
a	null
Livy	null
in	null
an	null
admirable	null
new	null
translation	null
by	null
Canon	null
Roberts	null
and	null
Caesar	null
Tacitus	null
Thucydides	null
and	null
Herodotus	null
are	null
not	null
forgotten	null
You	null
only	null
Books	null

The	null
variety	null
of	null
authors	null
old	null
and	null
new	null
the	null
wisdom	null
and	null
the	null
wit	null
at	null
the	null
disposal	null
of	null
Everyman	null
in	null
his	null
own	null
Library	null
may	null
well	null
at	null
times	null
seem	null
to	null
him	null
a	null
little	null
embarrassing	null
In	null
the	null
Essays	null
for	null
instance	null
he	null
may	null
turn	null
to	null
Dick	null
Steele	null
in	null
the	null
The	null
Spectator	null
and	null
learn	null
how	null
Cleomira	null
dances	null
when	null
the	null
elegance	null
of	null
her	null
motion	null
is	null
unimaginable	null
and	null
her	null
eyes	null
—	null
are	null
chastized	null
with	null
the	null
simplicity	null
and	null
innocence	null
of	null
her	null
thoughts	null
Or	null
he	null
may	null
take	null
A	null
Century	null
of	null
Essays	null
as	null
a	null
key	null
to	null
the	null
whole	null
roomful	null
of	null
the	null
English	null
Essayists	null
from	null
Bacon	null
to	null
Addison	null
Elia	null
to	null
Augustine	null
Birrell	null
These	null
are	null
the	null
golden	null
gossips	null
of	null
literature	null
the	null
writers	null
who	null
have	null
learnt	null
the	null
delightful	null
art	null
of	null
talking	null
on	null
paper	null
Or	null
again	null
the	null
reader	null
who	null
has	null
the	null
right	null
spirit	null
and	null
looks	null
on	null
all	null
literature	null
as	null
a	null
great	null
adventure	null
may	null
dive	null
back	null
into	null
the	null
classics	null
and	null
in	null
Platos	null
Phcedrus	null
read	null
how	null
every	null
soul	null
is	null
divided	null
into	null
three	null
parts	null
like	null
Caesars	null
Gaul	null
The	null
poets	null
next	null
and	null
we	null
may	null
turn	null
to	null
the	null
finest	null
critic	null
of	null
Victorian	null
times	null
Matthew	null
Arnold	null
as	null
their	null
showman	null
and	null
find	null
in	null
his	null
essay	null
on	null
Maurice	null
de	null
Guerin	null
a	null
clue	null
to	null
the	null
magical	null
power	null
of	null
poetry	null
as	null
in	null
Shakespeare	null
with	null
his	null
daffodils	null
That	null
come	null
before	null
the	null
swallow	null
dares	null
and	null
take	null
The	null
winds	null
of	null
March	null
with	null
beauty	null
William	null
Hazlitts	null
Table	null
Talk	null
may	null
help	null
again	null
to	null
show	null
the	null
relationship	null
of	null
one	null
author	null
to	null
another	null
which	null
is	null
another	null
form	null
of	null
the	null
Friendship	null
of	null
Books	null
His	null
incomparable	null
essay	null
On	null
Going	null
a	null
Journey	null
forms	null
a	null
capital	null
prelude	null
to	null
Coleridges	null
BiographiaLiteraria	null
and	null
so	null
throughout	null
the	null
long	null
labyrinth	null
of	null
the	null
Library	null
shelves	null
one	null
can	null
follow	null
the	null
magic	null
clue	null
in	null
prose	null
or	null
verse	null
that	null
leads	null
to	null
the	null
hidden	null
treasury	null
In	null
that	null
way	null
every	null
reader	null
becomes	null
his	null
own	null
critic	null
and	null
Doctor	null
of	null
Letters	null
In	null
the	null
same	null
way	null
one	null
may	null
turn	null
to	null
the	null
Byron	null
review	null
in	null
Macaulays	null
Essays	null
as	null
a	null
prelude	null
to	null
the	null
three	null
volumes	null
of	null
Byrons	null
own	null
poems	null
remembering	null
that	null
the	null
poet	null
whom	null
Europe	null
loved	null
more	null
than	null
England	null
did	null
was	null
as	null
Macaulay	null
said	null
the	null
beginning	null
the	null
middle	null
and	null
the	null
end	null
of	null
all	null
his	null
own	null
poetry	null
This	null
brings	null
us	null
to	null
the	null
provoking	null
reflection	null
that	null
it	null
is	null
the	null
obvious	null
authors	null
and	null
the	null
books	null
most	null
easy	null
to	null
reprint	null
which	null
have	null
been	null
the	null
signal	null
successes	null
out	null
of	null
the	null
many	null
hundreds	null
in	null
the	null
series	null
for	null
Everyman	null
is	null
distinctly	null
proverbial	null
in	null
—	null
—	null
his	null
tastes	null
He	null
likes	null
best	null
of	null
all	null
an	null
old	null
author	null
who	null
has	null
worn	null
well	null
or	null
a	null
comparatively	null
new	null
author	null
who	null
has	null
gained	null
something	null
like	null
newspaper	null
notoriety	null
In	null
attempting	null
to	null
lead	null
him	null
on	null
from	null
the	null
good	null
books	null
that	null
are	null
known	null
to	null
those	null
that	null
are	null
less	null
known	null
the	null
publishers	null
may	null
have	null
at	null
times	null
been	null
even	null
too	null
adventurous	null
But	null
the	null
elect	null
reader	null
is	null
or	null
ought	null
to	null
be	null
a	null
party	null
to	null
this	null
conspiracy	null
of	null
books	null
and	null
bookmen	null
He	null
can	null
make	null
it	null
possible	null
by	null
his	null
help	null
and	null
his	null
cooperative	null
zest	null
to	null
add	null
still	null
some	null
famous	null
old	null
authors	null
like	null
Burton	null
of	null
the	null
Anatomy	null
of	null
Melancholy	null
or	null
longer	null
novels	null
like	null
Richardsons	null
Clarissa	null
Harlowe	null
sl	null
cutandcomeagain	null
book	null
for	null
a	null
winter	null
fireside	null
or	null
more	null
modern	null
foreign	null
writers	null
like	null
Heine	null
whom	null
Havelock	null
Ellis	null
has	null
promised	null
to	null
sponsor	null
Infinite	null
riches	null
in	null
a	null
little	null
room	null
as	null
the	null
saying	null
is	null
will	null
be	null
the	null
reward	null
of	null
every	null
citizen	null
who	null
helps	null
year	null
by	null
year	null
to	null
build	null
the	null
City	null
of	null
Books	null
It	null
was	null
with	null
that	null
belief	null
in	null
its	null
possibilities	null
that	null
the	null
old	null
Chief	null
J	null
M	null
Dent	null
threw	null
himself	null
into	null
the	null
enterprise	null
With	null
the	null
zeal	null
of	null
a	null
true	null
booklover	null
he	null
thought	null
that	null
books	null
might	null
be	null
alive	null
and	null
productive	null
as	null
dragonsteeth	null
which	null
being	null
sown	null
up	null

down	null

might	null
chance	null
to	null

up	null

That	null
