INTRODUCTION	null
My	null
delight	null
in	null
Pride	null
and	null
Prejudice	null
is	null
so	null
manifold	null
that	null
I	null
hardly	null
know	null
how	null
to	null
begin	null
tlling	null
it	null
but	null
I	null
am	null
tempted	null
first	null
to	null
try	null
with	null
my	null
wonder	null
at	null
the	null
constantly	null
increasing	null
fame	null
of	null
the	null
author	null
Yet	null
her	null
fame	null
seems	null
the	null
least	null
thing	null
in	null
our	null
love	null
of	null
her	null
our	null
joy	null
in	null
her	null
subtle	null
and	null
beautiful	null
and	null
ever	null
adequate	null
art	null
It	null
is	null
the	null
dignity	null
and	null
sweetness	null
and	null
brightness	null
of	null
her	null
nature	null
which	null
take	null
us	null
most	null
and	null
our	null
affection	null
grows	null
in	null
honor	null
of	null
her	null
as	null
we	null
think	null
over	null
the	null
modest	null
facts	null
of	null
her	null
gentle	null
life	null
which	null
can	null
be	null
told	null
in	null
twenty	null
lines	null
but	null
never	null
can	null
be	null
told	null
oftn	null
enough	null
in	null
their	null
full	null
significance	null
Unless	null
daily	null
sacrifice	null
this	null
side	null
of	null
martyrdom	null
is	null
a	null
fault	null
there	null
is	null
nothing	null
to	null
blame	null
n	null
the	null
story	null
of	null
Jane	null
Austens	null
life	null
Out	null
other	null
idols	null
literary	null
idols	null
need	null
veils	null
in	null
their	null
temples	null
where	null
we	null
like	null
them	null
to	null
hide	null
certain	null
traits	null
from	null
us	null
while	null
we	null
worship	null
them	null
or	null
at	null
best	null
receive	null
from	null
us	null
a	null
piety	null
mixed	null
with	null
our	null
pity	null
we	null
cannot	null
help	null
knowing	null
they	null
were	null
poor	null
things	null
though	null
divine	null
If	null
our	null
human	null
frailties	null
our	null
vices	null
our	null
foiblee	null
have	null
a	null
consecration	null
in	null
them	null
it	null
does	null
not	null
keep	null
us	null
from	null
being	null
ashamed	null
or	null
at	null
best	null
sony	null
for	null
them	null
But	null
this	null
altogether	null
admirable	null
woman	null
good	null
as	null
she	null
waa	null
great	null
we	null
could	null
offer	null
pruse	null
without	null
such	null
reserve	null
when	null
we	null
joined	null
last	null
year	null
in	null
her	null
apotheosis	null
a	null
century	null
after	null
her	null
death	null
The	null
defects	null
of	null
faer	null
qualities	null
are	null
as	null
few	null
as	null
may	null
be	null
in	null
our	null
mortal	null
conditioning	null
and	null
they	null
have	null
the	null
charm	null
which	null
she	null
knew	null
how	null
to	null
impart	null
to	null
the	null
faulte	null
of	null
her	null
most	null
endearing	null
creations	null
But	null
to	null
talk	null
of	null
her	null
so	null
seems	null
an	null
offence	null
against	null
the	null
restrained	null
art	null
which	null
knew	null
no	null
excess	null
and	null
it	null
is	null
like	null
rather	null
noisily	null
boasting	null
of	null
the	null
perfectly	null
ascertained	null
loveiness	null
of	null
characters	null
like	null
Anne	null
Elliott	null
Emma	null
Woodhouse	null
Fanny	null
Price	null
Catherine	null
Moriand	null
and	null
above	null
all	null
Elizabeth	null
Bennet	null
which	null
each	null
in	null
ite	null
sort	null
derived	null
from	null
the	null
character	null
of	null
Jane	null
Austen	null
for	null
whether	null
she	null
knew	null
it	null
or	null
not	null
she	null
always	null
drew	null
from	null
herself	null
and	null
gave	null
the	null
creatures	null
she	null
loved	null
the	null
loveliness	null
of	null

INTRODUCllON	null
It	null
eeems	null
impossible	null
that	null
she	null
who	null
is	null
still	null
bo	null
freshly	null
young	null
and	null
whose	null
fame	null
now	null
fills	null
the	null
world	null
anew	null
was	null
born	null
a	null
hundred	null
and	null
forty	null
years	null
ago	null
Her	null
father	null
was	null
rector	null
of	null
the	null
livings	null
of	null
Steventon	null
and	null
Dean	null
which	null
adjoined	null
each	null
other	null
in	null
the	null
County	null
of	null
Hampshire	null
and	null
it	null
was	null
at	null
Steventon	null
that	null
she	null
came	null
into	null
the	null
world	null
the	null
fifth	null
of	null
a	null
good	null
many	null
brothers	null
and	null
sisters	null
There	null
she	null
grew	null
up	null
through	null
a	null
very	null
glad	null
girlhood	null
in	null
a	null
life	null
rounded	null
to	null
its	null
close	null
by	null
the	null
limits	null
of	null
pleasant	null
countrysides	null
in	null
Hants	null
and	null
Kent	null
and	null
such	null
now	null
shrunlcen	null
social	null
capitals	null
as	null
Bath	null
and	null
Southampton	null
and	null
Winchester	null
with	null
a	null
few	null
liberations	null
of	null
days	null
and	null
weeks	null
to	null
London	null
for	null
the	null
pictures	null
and	null
fashions	null
of	null
that	null
faded	null
day	null
Life	null
in	null
that	null
faded	null
day	null
was	null
less	null
provincial	null
in	null
provincial	null
towns	null
than	null
now	null
and	null
Jane	null
Austen	null
enjoyed	null
it	null
to	null
the	null
limit	null
of	null
her	null
happy	null
temperament	null
Against	null
the	null
background	null
of	null
their	null
gayeties	null
and	null
the	null
simpler	null
pleasures	null
of	null
the	null
country	null
and	null
the	null
joys	null
of	null
a	null
family	null
rich	null
in	null
the	null
dreaminp	null
and	null
doings	null
of	null
those	null
many	null
brothers	null
and	null
sisters	null
with	null
herself	null
first	null
in	null
their	null
incentives	null
she	null
painted	null
her	null
own	null
portrait	null
in	null
the	null
novels	null
she	null
wrote	null
for	null
twenty	null
years	null
and	null
the	null
letters	null
she	null
was	null
always	null
writii	null
to	null
the	null
end	null
But	null
in	null
her	null
own	null
time	null
her	null
star	null
shone	null
so	null
dimly	null
in	null
the	null
literary	null
firmament	null
that	null
only	null
here	null
and	null
there	null
a	null
telescopic	null
eye	null
distinguished	null
it	null
from	null
the	null
nebulous	null
host	null
and	null
such	null
meteoric	null
lustres	null
as	null
are	null
always	null
winking	null
about	null
the	null
heavens	null
of	null
every	null
time	null
The	null
greatest	null
and	null
kindest	null
of	null
her	null
contemporaries	null
knew	null
her	null
excellence	null
and	null
Scotts	null
generous	null
praise	null
confessed	null
her	null
gift	null
finer	null
than	null
his	null
own	null
but	null
criticism	null
grew	null
slowly	null
to	null
the	null
sense	null
of	null
it	null
Now	null
indeed	null
her	null
public	null
is	null
of	null
a	null
consciousness	null
so	null
intensively	null
pervasive	null
that	null
it	null
seems	null
as	null
if	null
the	null
literary	null
world	null
of	null
her	null
day	null
were	null
filled	null
with	null
her	null
alone	null
as	null
if	null
she	null
had	null
been	null
really	null
sole	null
in	null
it	null
but	null
that	null
is	null
a	null
very	null
mistaken	null
idea	null
She	null
was	null
not	null
alone	null
even	null
in	null
he	null
sort	null
and	null
this	null
renders	null
her	null
work	null
not	null
less	null
but	null
more	null
precious	null
If	null
she	null
was	null
Shakespearean	null
she	null
was	null

present	null
mirror	null
themselves	null
in	null
the	null
glancing	null
facets	null
of	null
her	null
work	null
and	null
her	null
art	null
was	null
beyond	null
that	null
of	null
all	null
the	null
other	null
writers	null
of	null
English	null
fiction	null
with	null
a	null
clear	null
light	null
which	null
has	null
steadily	null
glowed	null
for	null
a	null
hundred	null
years	null
Her	null
style	null
ha	null
the	null
rare	null
distinction	null
of	null
absolute	null
prose	null
which	null
at	null
times	null
has	null
the	null
anxiety	null
of	null
htrary	null
decorum	null
and	null
is	null
stiffened	null
by	null
the	null
formahty	null
of	null
the	null
eighteenth	null
century	null
ideals	null
but	null
is	null
often	null
of	null
the	null
simplicity	null
of	null
the	null
best	null
talk	null
and	null
always	null
of	null
the	null
naturalness	null
which	null
still	null
freshly	null
charms	null
It	null
is	null
never	null
of	null
poetic	null
quality	null
it	null
is	null
the	null
elect	null
speech	null
of	null
life	null
expressing	null
itself	null
without	null
pretending	null
to	null
emotions	null
not	null
felt	null
but	null
finding	null
human	null
nature	null
sufficient	null
for	null
its	null
highest	null
effects	null
Her	null
prose	null
is	null
never	null
of	null
rhythmical	null
movement	null
she	null
kept	null
her	null
dancing	null
for	null
the	null
balls	null
she	null
loved	null
and	null
her	null
joy	null
in	null
human	null
nature	null
seldom	null
went	null
beyond	null
it	null
to	null
the	null
nature	null
outside	null
of	null
it	null
Now	null
and	null
then	null
but	null
seldom	null
and	null
very	null
sparingly	null
she	null
brings	null

her	null
page	null
she	null
mentions	null
a	null

even	null
when	null

makes	null
no	null

she	null
permits	null
herself	null
a	null
restrained	null
topographical	null
statement	null
There	null
is	null

proof	null
that	null

prose	null
if	null
he	null

and	null
confided	null
it	null

because	null
he	null
must	null
Her	null
admiration	null
for	null

admirable	null
tales	null
in	null

a	null

pretence	null
of	null
passion	null
for	null
the	null
poet	null
himself	null
whom	null
she	null
avowed	null
her	null
purpose	null
of	null
marrying	null
without	null
asking	null
vdiether	null
he	null
had	null
a	null

I	null
had	null
never	null
reaUzed	null
before	null
the	null
open	null
simplicity	null
of	null
the	null
design	null
and	null
the	null
young	null
artlessness	null
of	null
its	null
art	null
so	null
young	null
that	null
every	null

then	null
the	null
artist	null
lapsed	null
to	null
the	null
artizan	null
and	null
frankly	null
operated	null
a	null
scheme	null
which	null
hesitated	null

operate	null
itself	null
The	null

But	null
arrcance	null
was	null
not	null
the	null
keynote	null
of	null

character	null

was	null
only	null

in	null
the	null
retrospect	null
one	null
bins	null
very	null
soon	null
to	null
guess	null
what	null
they	null
really	null
are	null
Darcy	null
indeed	null

Elizabeth	null
without	null

becomes	null
more	null

in	null

■	null
which	null
delights	null
from	null
her	null
to	null
the	null
happy	null
close	null
of	null
their	null
often	null

Her	null
very	null
fault	null

is	null

in	null

I	null
do	null
not	null
remember	null
any	null

case	null
of	null
a	null
gentleman	null
lying	null

am	null

the	null

may	null

happened	null

Jane	null

would	null

a	null
high	null
litCTary	null
gait	null
much	null
beyond	null
the	null
imagination	null
of	null
our	null

But	null
even	null
then	null
it	null
does	null
not	null
seem	null
probable	null
that	null
two	null
girls	null
talked	null
together	null
like	null
Ezabeth	null

her	null

Charlotte	null

that	null

throughout	null
tbe	null
long	null
Georgian	null

late	null
in	null
the	null
Victorian	null
time	null
when	null

had	null
escaped	null

the	null

he	null
never	null

simply	null
as	null
they	null

perhaps	null
never	null
unlearned	null
the	null

she	null
had	null
learned	null
so	null
painfuUy	null
as	null
well	null
as	null
with	null

But	null
I	null
think	null
that	null
in	null
each	null
successive	null
novel	null
her	null
people	null
employ	null
the	null
high	null
horse	null
less	null

less	null

their	null
great	null
emotions	null

keep	null
the	null
levels	null
of	null
life	null
afoot	null
the	null
levels	null
which	null
e	null
loved	null
beyond	null
any	null
other	null
when	null
she	null
could	null
consent	null
to	null
be	null
herself	null
or	null
let	null
them	null
be	null
themselves	null
I	null
venture	null
to	null
think	null
that	null
the	null
playful	null
family	null
spirit	null
may	null
have	null
forgotten	null
itself	null
in	null
the	null
office	null
of	null
criticism	null
which	null
again	null
I	null
fancy	null
it	null
must	null

mostly	null
created	null

very	null
possibly	null
I	null
am	null
wrong	null
though	null
I	null
bate	null

should	null

a	null

action	null
which	null
she	null

make	null

and	null
one	null
can	null
well	null
believe	null
that	null
the	null
family	null
circle	null

those	null
Austens	null
who	null
assisted	null
at	null
his	null
rehabilitation	null
long	null
before	null
it	null
was	null
made	null
public	null
did	null
not	null
share	null
the	null
imnable	null
severity	null
of	null
her	null
struggles	null
in	null
rendering	null
him	null
lovable	null
to	null
the	null
reader	null
It	null
must	null
have	null
been	null
a	null
Titanic	null
struggle	null
with	null
her	null
to	null
render	null
him	null
meek	null
and	null
modest	null
and	null
foiving	null
an	null
eater	null
of	null
humble	null
pie	null
in	null
quantity	null
unknown	null
among	null
heroes	null
and	null
quite	null
unexampled	null
in	null
the	null
lives	null
of	null
the	null
English	null
gentry	null
He	null
not	null
only	null
comes	null
to	null
the	null
rescue	null
of	null
the	null
loathsome	null
Lydia	null
but	null
he	null
yields	null
to	null
the	null
rapacity	null
of	null
Wickham	null
in	null
letting	null
him	null
fix	null
the	null
conditions	null
of	null
marrying	null
her	null
when	null
she	null
is	null
quite	null
willing	null
ia	null
remain	null
his	null
mistresSr	null
aiid	null
so	null
far	null
as	null
we	null
are	null
told	null
he	null
never	null
tries	null
to	null
beat	null
him	null
down	null
The	null
author	null
makes	null
him	null
the	null
scapegoat	null
of	null
the	null
situation	null
sheaccumulates	null
on	null
him	null
not	null
the	null
sins	null
but	null
the	null
virtues	null
of	null
his	null
tribe	null
then	null
she	null
drives	null
him	null
not	null
into	null
the	null
wilderness	null
but	null
into	null
paradise	null
The	null
miracle	null
is	null
in	null
time	null
for	null
Elizabeth	null
but	null
it	null
is	null
too	null
late	null
for	null
the	null
reader	null
So	null
it	null
seems	null
to	null
me	null
but	null
again	null
when	null
I	null
submitted	null
the	null
case	null
to	null
a	null
younger	null
reader	null
I	null
was	null
told	null
that	null
I	null
was	null
wrong	null
that	null
Darcy	null
is	null
perfectly	null
adorable	null
and	null
always	null
waa	null
and	null
that	null
if	null
Elizabeth	null
had	null
not	null
been	null
perverted	null
by	null
Wickham	null
and	null
infected	null
with	null
an	null
all	null
but	null
fatal	null
prejudice	null
she	null
would	null
hav	null
known	null
it	null
from	null
the	null
start	null
Perhaps	null
the	null
elderly	null
reader	null
is	null
not	null
given	null
time	null
to	null
recover	null
from	null
the	null
effect	null
of	null
Darcys	null
arrogant	null
offer	null
of	null
his	null
love	null
to	null
Elizabeth	null
his	null
acknowledgment	null
of	null
his	null
contempt	null

himself	null

every	null

himself	null

of	null
a	null

by	null

considerate	null
and	null
even	null
meek	null
at	null
every	null
point	null
where	null
you	null
would	null
have	null
him	null
so	null
All	null
this	null
is	null
supposed	null
to	null
happen	null
but	null
life	null
is	null
short	null
especially	null
for	null
elderly	null
readers	null
and	null
the	null
art	null
of	null
the	null
author	null
is	null
long	null
in	null
bringing	null
her	null
ends	null
about	null
she	null
brings	null
them	null
about	null
by	null
very	null
rough	null
magic	null
at	null
times	null
The	null
surrender	null
of	null
Darey	null
is	null
effected	null
by	null
main	null
force	null
when	null
he	null
first	null
offers	null
himself	null
and	null
the	null
struggle	null
is	null
not	null
so	null
hard	null
to	null
have	null
him	null
renew	null
his	null
suit	null
By	By
that	null
time	null
Elisabeth	null
had	null
worked	null
round	null
to	null
him	null
when	null
he	null
had	null
become	null
unattainable	null
and	null
they	null
had	null
reached	null
their	null
common	null
conclusion	null
that	null
they	null
had	null
each	null
thrown	null
a	null
pearl	null
away	null
Still	null
the	null
affair	null
is	null
obviously	null
operated	null
and	null
if	null
it	null
had	null
not	null
been	null
for	null

and	null
the	null
diraiM	null
which	null
Darcy	null
was	null
obUged	null
to	null
share	null
with	null
Elizabeth	null
I	null
could	null
not	null
accept	null
the	null
conclusion	null
as	null
inevitable	null
It	null
is	null
to	null
be	null
allowed	null
that	null
they	null
talk	null
reasonably	null
about	null
the	null
event	null
which	null
shocks	null
everybody	null
but	null
Lydia	null

Wickham	null
and	null
it	null
is	null

be	null

was	null
ever	null
treated	null
in	null
its	null
minor	null

your	null

you	null

a	null
binning	null
but	null
what	null
could	null
set	null
you	null
off	null
in	null
the	null

My	null
beauty	null
you	null
had	null
eariy	null
withstood	null
and	null
as	null
for	null
my	null
mamiers	null
my	null
behavior	null
to	null
you	null
was	null
always	null
at	null

bordering	null
on	null
the	null
uncivil	null
and	null
I	null
never	null
spoke	null
to	null
you	null
without	null
rather	null
wishing	null

give	null
you	null

not	null
Now	null
be	null

did	null
you	null

my	null

You	null
may	null
as	null

call	null
it	null
impertinence	null
at	null
once	null
In	null
spite	null
of	null
the	null

you	null
took	null
to	null
disgiuse	null
yourself	null
your	null

There	null
I	null

the	null

of	null
accounting	null

it	null
and	null
really	null
all	null
things	null
considered	null
I	null
begin	null
to	null
think	null
it	null
perfectly	null
reasonable	null
To	null
be	null

you	null
knew	null
no	null
actual	null
good	null
of	null

nobody	null
thinks	null

The	null

when	null

out	null

stirring	null

tlie	null

the	null

But	null
perfiaps	null

the	null

it	null
is	null
a	null

tribute	null
to	null
her	null
character	null

she	null
reveals	null
it	null
when	null
Darcy	null
tolls	null
her	null
of	null
Wickhams	null
attempted	null
elopement	null
with	null
his	null
innocent	null
young	null
ster	null
when	null
he	null
wishes	null
to	null
make	null
her	null
understand	null
perfectly	null
how	null
mistaken	null
she	null
has	null
been	null
It	null
is	null
the	null
greatest	null
sacrifice	null
of	null
himself	null
that	null
he	null
can	null
oSer	null
and	null
is	null
far	null
beyond	null
his	null
gentlemanly	null
instinct	null
in	null

girl	null
to	null
call	null
upon	null
Elizabeth	null
after	null
their	null
accidental	null
meeting	null
at	null
Pemberley	null
Iliat	null
is	null
something	null
he	null
owes	null
to	null
himself	null
as	null
a	null
gentleman	null
but	null
the	null
otjier	null
is	null
something	null
he	null
owes	null
to	null
her	null
I	null
can	null
scarcely	null
think	null
of	null
any	null
point	null
where	null
she	null
fails	null
in	null
her	null
claim	null
on	null
our	null
affection	null
our	null
respect	null
though	null
she	null
is	null
often	null
mistaken	null
and	null
sometimes	null
absurd	null
It	null
is	null
no	null
wonder	null
that	null
the	null
author	null
loves	null
her	null
and	null
cannot	null
think	null
of	null
her	null
but	null
as	null
the	null
finest	null
creature	null
in	null
that	null
world	null
of	null
imagination	null
where	null
she	null
mostly	null
had	null
her	null

for	null

as	null
Darcy	null

all	null
her	null
kindred	null

Not	null
everything	null

the	null
things	null
that	null
must	null

inevitably	null

To	null

she	null

much	null
in	null

Wickham	null
a	null

the	null

were	null
almost	null

for	null

The	null

her	null
with	null
a	null
not	null

the	null
truth	null
of	null
Dareys	null
cruel	null
arraignment	null
of	null
her	null

It	null

under	null
the	null

does	null
not	null
seem	null
unreasonable	null
There	null
is	null
no	null
such	null
hope	null
for	null
her	null
mother	null
but	null
we	null
would	null
not	null
have	null
Mrs	null
Bennet	null
less	null
perfect	null
a	null
fool	null
than	null
she	null
is	null
to	null
the	null
last	null
What	null
ie	null
most	null
wonderful	null
in	null
her	null
is	null
the	null
perennial	null
youthfulness	null
of	null
her	null
folly	null
She	null
is	null
never	null
any	null
older	null
than	null
the	null
youngest	null
of	null
her	null
daughters	null
but	null
it	null
is	null
to	null
be	null
owned	null
for	null
her	null
rapture	null
in	null
Lydias	null
marriage	null
that	null
it	null
is	null
not	null
greater	null
than	null
in	null
that	null
of	null
Jane	null
and	null
of	null
Elizabeth	null
though	null
in	null
her	null
mounting	null
satisfaction	null
with	null
their	null
successively	null
mounting	null
wealth	null
and	null
station	null
she	null
tries	null
not	null
to	null
distinguish	null
among	null
them	null
I	null
am	null
not	null
quite	null
sure	null
that	null
I	null
like	null
her	null
being	null
somewhat	null
quelled	null
by	null
Darcy	null
but	null
it	null
is	null
inevitable	null
and	null
it	null
is	null
to	null
be	null
considered	null
that	null
she	null
remains	null
equal	null
to	null
her	null
affectionate	null
and	null
familiar	null
deUght	null
in	null
Bingley	null
and	null
Jane	null
and	null
I	null
think	null
it	null
to	null
Bingleys	null
credit	null
that	null
he	null
does	null
not	null
and	null
could	null
not	null
do	null
anything	null
to	null
snub	null
her	null
overwhelming	null
fondness	null
This	null
if	null
there	null
were	null
no	null
other	null
proof	null
of	null
his	null
goodness	null
would	null
be	null
quite	null
enoi	null
Jane	null
is	null
equal	null
to	null
the	null
even	null
greater	null
task	null
of	null
loving	null
hia	null
unkind	null
sisters	null
though	null
I	null
doubt	null
if	null
Elizabeth	null
ever	null
admitted	null
Miss	null
Binglejfs	null
overtures	null
to	null
her	null
friendship	null
after	null
she	null
was	null
married	null
to	null
Darcy	null
I	null
think	null
there	null
must	null
always	null
have	null
been	null
some	null
flashes	null
of	null
her	null
irony	null
to	null
light	null
up	null
the	null
forgiveness	null
of	null
the	null
friend	null
who	null
meant	null
him	null
for	null
herself	null
and	null
tried	null
for	null
him	null
throu	null
every	null
discouragement	null
We	null
must	null
take	null
leave	null
of	null
the	null
whole	null
company	null
of	null
comedians	null
who	null
have	null
been	null
kept	null
from	null
that	null
bleakness	null
of	null
tragedy	null
which	null
ie	null
not	null
very	null
common	null
off	null
the	null
stae	null
though	null
the	null
dramatists	null
would	null
like	null
us	null
to	null
think	null
differently	null
and	null
are	null
so	null
often	null
asking	null
us	null
to	null
share	null
their	null
tears	null
for	null
it	null
liiere	null
is	null
trouble	null
enough	null
in	null
real	null
life	null
but	null
it	null
is	null
mostly	null
annulled	null
by	null
the	null
use	null
of	null
common	null
sense	null
and	null
patience	null
and	null
kindness	null
even	null
by	null
people	null
who	null
have	null
tried	null
to	null
do	null
themselves	null
mischief	null
Perhaps	null
something	null
like	null
the	null
oversoul	null
helps	null
the	null
good	null
ending	null
and	null
leaves	null
us	null
quite	null
comfortable	null
if	null
not	null
peifectiy	null
contented	null
We	null
might	null
have	null
wished	null
Wickham	null
punished	null
to	null
the	null
limit	null
of	null
his	null
deserts	null
but	null
we	null
can	null
manage	null
with	null
the	null
quiet	null
scorn	null
Elizabeth	null
makes	null
him	null
fed	null
when	null
she	null
spares	null
faim	null

it	null
is	null
her	null
sufficient	null
