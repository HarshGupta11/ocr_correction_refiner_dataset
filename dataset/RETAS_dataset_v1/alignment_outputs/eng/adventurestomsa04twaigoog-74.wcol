own	null
the	null
rest	null

of	null
boys	null
who	null
were	null
schoolmates	null
of	null
mine	null
Huck	null
Finn	null
is	null
drawn	null
from	null
life	null
Tom	null
Sawyer	null
also	null
but	null
not	null
from	null
an	null
individual	null
—	null
he	null
is	null
a	null
combination	null
of	null
the	null
characteristics	null
of	null
three	null
boys	null
whom	null
I	null
knew	null
and	null
therefore	null
belongs	null
to	null
the	null
composite	null
order	null
of	null
architecture	null
The	null
odd	null
superstitions	null
touched	null
upon	null
were	null
all	null
prevalent	null
among	null
children	null
and	null
slaves	null
in	null
the	null
West	null
at	null
the	null
period	null
of	null
this	null
story	null
—	null
that	null
is	null
to	null
say	null
thirty	null
or	null
forty	null
years	null
ago	null
Although	null
my	null
book	null
is	null
intended	null
mainly	null
for	null
the	null
entertainment	null
of	null
boys	null
and	null
girls	null
I	null
hope	null
it	null
will	null
not	null
be	null
shunned	null
by	null
men	null
and	null
women	null
on	null
that	null
account	null
for	null
part	null
of	null
my	null
plan	null
has	null
been	null
to	null
try	null
to	null
pleasantly	null
remind	null
adults	null
of	null
what	null
they	null
once	null
were	null
themselves	null
and	null
of	null
how	null
they	null
felt	null
and	null
thought	null
and	null
talked	null
and	null
what	null
queer	null
enterprises	null
they	null
sometimes	null
engaged	null
