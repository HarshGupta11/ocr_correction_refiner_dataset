this	null

announcing	null
that	null
the	null

hitherto	null
priced	null
at	null
four	null

is	null
now	null
to	null

on	null
the	null
same	null
terms	null
as	null
the	null
ordinary	null

—	null
although	null
I	null
feel	null
sure	null
that	null
it	null
is	null
in	null
every	null
quality	null
except	null
the	null
t	null
itself	null
on	null
which	null
I	null
am	null
not	null
qualified	null
to	null
pronounce	null
greatly	null
superior	null
to	null
them	null
Four	null
shillings	null
was	null
a	null
perfectly	null
reasonable	null
price	null
to	null
charge	null
considering	null
the	null
very	null
heavy	null
initial	null
outlay	null
I	null
had	null
incurr	null
still	null
as	null
the	null
Public	null

said	null
We	null
will	null
not	null
give	null
more	null
than	null
a	null

for	null
a	null
picturebook	null
however	null
artistically	null
gotup	null
I	null
am	null
content	null
to	null
reckon	null
my	null
outlay	null
on	null
the	null
book	null
as	null
so	null
much	null
dead	null
loss	null
and	null
rather	null
than	null
let	null
the	null
little	null
ones	null
for	null
whom	null
it	null
was	null
written	null
go	null
without	null
it	null
I	null
am	null
selling	null
it	null
at	null
a	null
price	null
which	null
is	null
to	null
me	null
much	null
the	null
