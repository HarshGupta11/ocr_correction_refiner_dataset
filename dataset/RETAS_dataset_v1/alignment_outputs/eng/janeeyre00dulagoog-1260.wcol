INTRODUCTION	null
i	null
There	null
are	null
a	null
few	null
novels	null
that	null
stand	null
alane	null
without	null
ancestry	null
f	null
without	null
affinity	null
in	null
literature	null
One	null
of	null
the	null
few	null
is	null
■	null
Jane	null
Eyrea	null
book	null
that	null
has	null
had	null
innumerable	null
descendants	null
but	null
no	null
traceable	null
descent	null
Charlotte	null
Bronte	null
was	null
not	null
shaped	null
by	null
any	null
influence	null
that	null
we	null
can	null
discover	null
among	null
her	null
predecessors	null
aad	null
contemporaries	null
Out	null
of	null
her	null
curious	null
and	null
varied	null
reading	null
she	null
formed	null
a	null
style	null
exclusively	null
and	null
inimitably	null
her	null
own	null
and	null
sent	null
forth	null
from	null
her	null
remote	null
Yorkshire	null
village	null
a	null
book	null
only	null
less	null
wonderful	null
than	null
Wuthering	null
Heights	null
To	null
realise	null
its	null
unique	null
and	null
starthng	null
quality	null
it	null
should	null
be	null
remembered	null
that	null
Jane	null
Eyre	null
was	null
written	null
in	null
and	null
published	null
in	null
the	null
same	null
year	null
as	null
Vanity	null
FairMrs	null
GaBkeUs	null
Mary	null
Barton	null
had	null
not	null
then	null
appeared	null
George	null
Eliot	null
did	null
not	null
begin	null
to	null
write	null
till	null
about	null
ten	null
years	null
later	null
A	null
great	null
gulf	null
divided	null
Charlotte	null
Bronte	null
from	null
Jane	null
Austen	null
Jane	null
Austen	null
would	null
probably	null
not	null
have	null
appreciated	null
Charlotte	null
Bronte	null
We	null
know	null
that	null
Charlotte	null
did	null
not	null
appreciate	null
Jane	null
She	null
asks	null
George	null
Henry	null
LeweSj	null
Why	null
do	null
you	null
like	null
Miss	null
Austen	null
so	null
very	null
much	null
She	null
cannot	null
see	null
why	null
She	null
finds	null
her	null
only	null
shrewd	null
and	null
observant	null
and	null
asks	null
again	null
r	null
Can	null
there	null
be	null
a	null
great	null
artist	null
without	null
poetry	null
There	null
is	null
something	null
alien	null
and	null
unsympathetic	null
to	null
her	null
in	null
Jane	null
Austens	null
finish	null
and	null
reserve	null
She	null
has	null
no	null
patience	null
with	null
her	null
exquisite	null
art	null
For	null
her	null
it	null
is	null
finished	null
because	null
there	null
is	null
no	null
more	null
behind	null
it	null
and	null
reserved	null
because	null
the	null
best	null
part	null
of	null
life	null
is	null
kept	null
out	null
of	null
it	null
For	null
Charlotte	null
Bronte	null
the	null
best	null
part	null
of	null
life	null
is	null
the	null
passion	null
that	null
exalts	null
and	null
transfigures	null
it	null
Passion	null
is	null
poetry	null
poetry	null
is	null
passion	null
It	null
is	null
the	null
truth	null
of	null
men	null
and	null
women	null
Some	null

none	null

this	null
troth	null

such	null
are	null

JANE	null
EYRE	null
her	null
Lydia	null
very	null
eflfectively	null
to	null
show	null
what	null
a	null
vulgar	null
thing	null
passion	null
is	null
Of	null
Mrs	null
Rushworth	null
she	null
says	null
less	null
intimating	null
that	null
the	null
less	null
said	null
the	null
better	null
Passion	null
was	null
Charlotte	null
Brontes	null
secret	null
She	null
gave	null
a	null
new	null
meaning	null
to	null
the	null
word	null
She	null
was	null
the	null
first	null
novelist	null
to	null
handle	null
the	null
thing	null
the	null
real	null
thing	null
Jane	null
Austen	null
was	null
not	null
alone	null
in	null
her	null
ignorance	null
of	null
it	null
None	null
of	null
the	null
older	null
novelists	null
had	null
treated	null
it	null
adequately	null
For	null
Scott	null
it	null
was	null
simply	null
a	null
high	null
vague	null
romantic	null
feeling	null
that	null
hung	null
round	null
his	null
characters	null
like	null
a	null
dress	null
Richardson	null
got	null
somewhere	null
near	null
it	null
in	null
Clarissa	null
Harlowe	null
without	null
knowing	null
it	null
His	null
vision	null
was	null
impaired	null
by	null
the	null
damp	null
fog	null
of	null
sentiment	null
in	null
which	null
he	null
loved	null
to	null
hve	null
To	null
Fielding	null
passion	null
meant	null
animal	null
passion	null
and	null
as	null
such	null
he	null
rightly	null
held	null
it	null
unimportant	null
For	null
Thackeray	null
tob	null
it	null
is	null
a	null
sharp	null
fever	null
of	null
the	null
senses	null
to	null
be	null
treated	null
with	null
tiie	null
brevity	null
its	null
episodic	null
and	null
accidental	null
character	null
deserves	null
Nbne	null
of	null
these	null
novelists	null
understood	null
by	null
passion	null
what	null
Charlotte	null
BrontS	null
understood	null
And	null
the	null
comfortable	null
sentimental	null
thoroughly	null
prosaic	null
Early	null
Victorians	null
who	null
devoured	null
Jane	null
Eyre	null
did	null
not	null
understand	null
it	null
either	null
and	null
were	null
shocked	null
For	null
ais	null
there	null
was	null
nothing	null
to	null
account	null
for	null
Jane	null
Ene	null
Jane	null
Eyre	null
refused	null
to	null
be	null
accountable	null
It	null
made	null
havoc	null
of	null
all	null
literary	null
tradition	null
It	null
is	null
hard	null
to	null
realise	null
the	null
enormity	null
of	null
Janes	null
behaviour	null
nowadajrs	null
when	null
we	null
take	null
up	null
the	null
book	null
and	null
find	null
to	null
our	null
surprise	null
that	null
when	null
all	null
is	null
said	null
and	null
done	null
the	null
ten	null
commandments	null
remain	null
mudi	null
as	null
they	null
were	null
before	null
In	null
ft	null
very	null
little	null
is	null
said	null
and	null
nothing	null
at	null
all	null
is	null
doile	null
which	null
we	null
can	null
take	null
exceptioh	null
to	null
Whether	null
a	null
man	null
with	null
a	null
mad	null
wife	null
may	null
not	null
marry	null
another	null
is	null
not	null
a	null
problem	null
stated	null
by	null
Charlotte	null
Bronte	null
It	null
is	null
a	null
mere	null
side	null
issue	null
raised	null
by	null
Rochester	null
in	null
a	null
moment	null
of	null
ungovernable	null
fury	null
Janes	null
conscience	null
settles	null
it	null
at	null
once	null
with	null
an	null
uncompromising	null
No	null
It	null
is	null
not	null
the	null
ten	null
commandments	null
that	null
are	null
broken	null
it	null
is	null
the	null
unwritten	null
Uws	null
of	null
literature	null
It	null
was	null
one	null
of	null
these	null
laws	null
that	null
a	null
governess	null
should	null
know	null
her	null
place	null
and	null
that	null
a	null
plain	null
woman	null
should	null
know	null
hers	null
and	null
be	null
kept	null
in	null
it	null
Then	null
Jane	null
Eyre	null
came	null
and	null
made	null
waste	null
paper	null
of	null
this	null
convention	null
She	null
put	null
ideas	null
into	null
the	null
heads	null
of	null
governesses	null
and	null
plain	null
women	null
In	null
the	null
novel	null
of	null
the	null
past	null
no	null
woman	null
with	null
a	null
face	null
and	null
figure	null
like	null
Jane	null
could	null
hope	null
for	null
more	null
than	null
a	null
mere	null
walkingon	null
part	null
at	null
best	null
for	null
the	null
re	null
of	null
a	null
very	null
minor	null
char	null
ITRODUCTIOI	null
acter	null
Jane	null
appears	null
as	null
leading	null
lady	null
and	null
sustains	null
the	null
part	null
with	null
triumphant	null
succe	null
Blanche	null
Ingram	null
the	null
tall	null
stately	null
Early	null
Victorian	null
heroine	null
is	null
a	null
mere	null
temporary	null
foil	null
to	null
littJe	null
Jane	null
There	null
is	null
a	null
shade	null
too	null
miich	null
intention	null
in	null
Charlotte	null
Brontes	null
treatment	null
of	null
Blanche	null
It	null
is	null
as	null
if	null
she	null
said	null
to	null
the	null
reader	null
I	null
will	null
take	null
your	null
beautiful	null
heroine	null
and	null
show	null
you	null
how	null
deadly	null
dull	null
how	null
ineffectual	null
she	null
is	null
beside	null
my	null
Jane	null
I	null
will	null
make	null
you	null
sick	null
of	null
her	null
black	null
eyes	null
and	null
her	null
swaalike	null
neck	null
of	null
her	null
raven	null
locks	null
and	null
the	null
silly	null
rose	null
she	null
wears	null
in	null
them	null
and	null
of	null
that	null
eternal	null
scarf	null
which	null
she	null
drapes	null
about	null
her	null
sloping	null
shoulders	null
So	null
Blanche	null
Ingram	null
appears	null
in	null
Mr	null
Rochesters	null
drawingroom	null
and	null
talks	null
like	null
this	null
to	null
the	null
footman	null
after	null
having	null
ejaculated	null
GqI	null
Cease	null
that	null
chatter	null
blockhead	null
and	null
do	null
my	null
bidding	null
For	null
Blanche	null
IS	null
nothing	null
if	null
not	null
haughty	null
Now	null
this	null
is	null
hardly	null
fair	null
treatment	null
even	null
for	null
a	null
foil	null
and	null
no	null
wonder	null
that	null
Blanche	null
Ingram	null
dies	null
of	null
it	null
strangled	null
by	null
the	null
vindictive	null
hands	null
of	null
her	null
creator	null
Blanche	null
was	null
not	null
the	null
only	null
beautiful	null
idol	null
that	null
Charlotte	null
Bronte	null
broke	null
Not	null
only	null
was	null
it	null
established	null
that	null
a	null
plain	null
woman	null
should	null
know	null
her	null
place	null
there	null
was	null
another	null
more	null
ancient	null
and	null
formidable	null
tradition	null
No	null
woman	null
should	null
know	null
her	null
own	null
nature	null
until	null
some	null
man	null
and	null
he	null
must	null
be	null
her	null
husband	null
revs	null
it	null
to	null
her	null
Over	null
this	null
superstition	null
Jane	null
Eyre	null
really	null
rode	null
roughshod	null
She	null
had	null
the	null
audacity	null
to	null
declare	null
herself	null
in	null
love	null
with	null
Rochester	null
before	null
Rochester	null
had	null
thrown	null
the	null
handkerchief	null
She	null
stole	null
the	null
handkerchief	null
out	null
of	null
Rochesters	null
pocket	null
while	null
Rochester	null
was	null
sleeping	null
If	null
she	null
had	null
smashed	null
all	null
the	null
ten	null
commandments	null
at	null
once	null
the	null
world	null
then	null
in	null
the	null
first	null
blush	null
of	null
its	null
Early	null
Victoriaa	null
propriety	null
could	null
not	null
have	null
been	null
more	null
horrified	null
Jane	null
Eyre	null

milk	null
and	null
water	null
to	null
Catherine	null
Eamshaw	null
and	null
Rochester	null

stagepuppet	null
beside	null

But	null
the	null
generation	null
that	null
shuddered	null
over	null
Jane	null
was	null
unmoved	null
by	null
Wuthering	null
Heights	null
The	null
tremendous	null
success	null
of	null
Jane	null
Eyre	null
overshadowed	null
for	null
a	null
while	null

The	null
tendency	null
nowadays	null
is	null
to	null
praise	null
Emily	null
Bronte	null
at	null
her	null
sisters	null
expense	null
It	null
has	null

raked	null
up	null
poor	null

Mrg	null
Oliphants	null

first	null
the	null
evidence	null
from	null
Charlotte	null
Brontes	null
life	null
from	null
her	null
letters	null
from	null
her	null
character	null
aa	null
revealed	null
in	null
her	null
works	null
and	null
from	null
her	null
own	null
marriage	null
all	null
goes	null
to	null
prove	null
that	null
she	null
dealt	null
with	null
the	null
prospect	null
in	null
an	null
uncommonly	null
detached	null
shrewd	null
and	null
fiob	null
spirit	null
and	null
with	null
an	null
admirably	null
light	null
hand	null
In	null
fact	null
she	null
may	null
be	null
said	null
to	null
have	null
approached	null
thia	null
solemn	null
subject	null
with	null
what	null
was	null
for	null
that	null
sentimental	null
Early	null
Victorian	null
age	null
an	null
almost	null
nn	null
becoming	null
levity	null
As	null
for	null
M	null
Hger	null
it	null
was	null
Charlotte	null
Brontes	null
imagination	null
not	null
her	null
heart	null
that	null
occupied	null
itself	null
so	null
fervently	null
with	null
him	null
It	null
shaped	null
him	null
to	null
its	null
own	null
uses	null
Unfortunately	null
she	null
died	null
before	null
she	null
could	null
prove	null
that	null
he	null
was	null
not	null
becoming	null
an	null
obsession	null
It	null
is	null
high	null
time	null
that	null
all	null
this	null
nonsense	null
shonld	null
be	null
dropped	null
Charlotte	null
Brontes	null
genins	null
her	null
heroic	null
goodness	null
and	null
her	null
sufferings	null
should	null
have	null
placed	null
her	null
beyond	null
its	null
profanation	null
She	null
has	null
given	null
to	null
the	null
world	null
men	null
and	null
women	null
who	null
will	null
hve	null
with	null
all	null
that	null
is	null
enduring	null
in	null
English	null
literature	null
Some	null
of	null
her	null
characters	null
have	null
been	null
identified	null
with	null
some	null
persons	null
of	null
her	null
actual	null
experience	null
And	null
this	null
has	null
done	null
the	null
mischief	null
The	null
man	null
in	null
the	null
street	null
who	null
loves	null
biography	null
cannot	null
realise	null
the	null
unimportance	null
of	null
these	null
identifications	null
He	null
cannot	null
see	null
that	null
genius	null
has	null
httle	null
need	null
of	null
actual	null
experience	null
as	null
he	null
understands	null
it	null
and	null
that	null
it	null
owes	null
no	null
account	null
to	null
him	null
Of	null
its	null
workings	null
the	null
world	null
has	null
no	null
right	null
to	null
any	null
other	null
explanation	null
than	null
that	null
which	null
Charlotte	null
Bronte	null
has	null

The	null

of	null

Before	null
h	null
the	null
most	null

and	null

No	null
one	null
has	null
ever	null
questioned	null
her	null
right	null
to	null
understand	null
the	null
passion	null
of	null
Catherine	null

Heathcliff	null
What	null
after	null

was	null
the	null
passion	null
that	null

It	null

It	null

Her	null
Janes	null
upward	null
gaze	null
is	null
the	null
very	null
sublime	null
of	null
faith	null
truth	null
and	null
devotion	null
She	null
has	null
not	null
only	null
shown	null
in	null
Jane	null
the	null

In	null
Charlotte	null
Brontes	null

passion	null
becomes	null
a	null
thing	null
of	null
strange	null
inno	null
cences	null
and	null
tendernesses	null
and	null
terrors	null
rejoicing	null
in	null

and	null
the	null

A	null

and	null
her	null
tendency	null
to	null

to	null

remains	null
to	null
this	null
day	null
young	null
and	null
sjidid	null
and	null
modem	null
to	null
her	null
fingertips	null
But	null
Jane	null
is	null
not	null
all	null
passion	null
She	null
is	null
a	null
complex	null
person	null
a	null
woman	null
of	null
character	null
Charlotte	null
Bronti	null
was	null
like	null
Jane	null
Austenshrewd	null
and	null

moreover	null
and	null
with	null
a	null
merry	null
devil	null
in	null
her	null
which	null
Rochester	null
loves	null
to	null
draw	null
We	null
are	null
not	null
merely	null
told	null
that	null
he	null
found	null
Jane	null
fascinating	null
We	null
are	null
made	null
to	null
realise	null
every	null
element	null
of	null
the	null
fascination	null
f	null
The	null
earlier	null
scenes	null
of	null
Rochesters	null
lovemaking	null
are	null
not	null
only	null
among	null
the	null
best	null
in	null
the	null
book	null
they	null
are	null
unique	null
in	null
litera	null

They	null
brought	null
a	null
new	null
mood	null
into	null
the	null
comedy	null
of	null

To	null
those	null
who	null
are	null
accustomed	null
to	null

only	null
of	null
the	null
tragic	null
quality	null
of	null
the	null
Bronte	null
it	null
will	null
be	null
startling	null
to	null
hear	null
that	null
Charlotte	null
was	null
great	null
in	null
comedy	null
But	null
from	null
the	null
moment	null
when	null
Rochester	null
sars	null
You	null
examine	null

Miss	null

No	null

in	null

where	null

are	null
lapses	null
from	null
this	null

The	null
language	null
of	null
Jane	null
and	null
Rochester	null
occasionally	null
defies	null
the	null
